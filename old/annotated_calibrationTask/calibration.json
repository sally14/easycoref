{"id": 1932, "text": "Globally, there have been more than 29.5 million cases and 935,900 fatalities. UAE approves vaccine developed in China for emergency use The United Arab Emirates' government authorized Emergency Use Authorization of a COVID -19 vaccine developed in China for first line defense heroes, the country's National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority tweeted. Abdul Rahman Bin Mohammed Al Owais, UAE's Minister of Health and Prevention, said results from preclinical studies, first and second phase trials showed the vaccine is safe and effective, and that the third phase is progressing very well. According to NCEMA, 31,000 volunteers participated in clinical trials. The agency observed mild side effects including pain in the injection area, fatigue and headache. The vaccine will be given to front-line workers who interact with people who are infected. India surpasses 5 million cases India's coronavirus cases are still soaring and testing the country's feeble health care system in tens of thousands of impoverished towns and villages. The Health Ministry reported 90,123 new cases in 24 hours, raising the nation's confirmed total to 5,020,359, about 0.35% of its nearly 1.4 billion population. India's total coronavirus caseload is closing in on the United States' highest tally of more than 6.6 million cases and expected to surpass it within weeks. India reported a record daily high of 97,570 cases on Sept. 11 and has added more than 1 million cases this month alone. Trump denies downplaying coronavirus during town hall President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied downplaying the threat from coronavirus , telling a television town hall that he up-played it despite his assertion in an interview earlier this year that he wanted to always play it down. Trump made the remarks during a 90-minute town hall hosted by ABC News in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Well, I didn't downplay it. I actually, in many ways, I up-played it in terms of action, Trump said in response to a question about an interview with journalist Bob Woodward in which he said he knew the coronavirus was more deadly and contagious than the flu but continued to compare the two.

The U.K. government also agreed to work with the company on a late-stage study testing its vaccine as a two-dose regimen, according to J Ending the current COVID -19 pandemic will take a global effort, and this agreement is an important example of how we can begin to address this significant challenge through collaborative research, J Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said. J began testing its vaccine in a small number of healthy volunteers last month, and a late-stage trial of the vaccine as a single shot could begin this fall. Related Coverage * EU Secures Coronavirus Vaccine Deal With AstraZeneca * Untested for Covid -19, Nursing-Home Inspectors Move Through Facilities * New Covid -19 Cases Top 50,000 in U.S. for Second Straight Day The vaccines are among the most advanced in development, though not as far along as shots under development by companies including AstraZeneca PLC , Moderna Inc . and a partnership between Pfizer Inc . and BioNTech SE . This week, Russia said it was clearing a homegrown vaccine for use by its general public, though researchers expressed concerns about the adequacy of evidence supporting the shot's safety and effectiveness. The U.K., the U.S. and other countries have been reaching deals worth billions of dollars with companies developing the vaccines to lock in doses should the shots prove to work safely. The U.K. last month struck a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for 30 million doses, after agreeing to pay AstraZeneca for 100 million doses of a vaccine the company developed with the University of Oxford . The U.K. government is also set to receive 60 million doses of an experimental vaccine under development by Valneva SE of France. Novavax , of Gaithersburg, Md., was founded in 1987 but doesn't have any products on the market. Its coronavirus vaccine is expected to require two shots. It is scheduled to begin mid-stage, or Phase 2, testing this month. The company has now struck several deals with governments, companies and foundations that would see its vaccine distributed in South Korea, Japan and India, among other places. The U.S. agreed to pay up to $1.6 billion to Novavax to fund the final stage, or Phase 3, of testing of the company's vaccine and obtain 100 million doses.", "annotations": [{"label": 17,

{"id": 1935, "text": "The virus quickly spread into their upper and lower respiratory tracts. The nine monkeys developed viral pneumonia, but all recovered within 28 days. A week later, researchers exposed the monkeys to the virus a second time. Although the scientists were able to detect tiny amounts of the virus in the lungs of some of the monkeys, none of the animals got sick. Their immune systems protected them. “It has long been suspected that there would be natural protective immunity [after recovery from COVID -19] because most viruses do that, but that's not always the case, said Barouch, who cited HIV as a notable exception. “Our team found this data very compelling. If the finding was confirmed in humans, it might fuel calls for “immunity passports for people who recover from COVID -19 and test positive for the antibodies. That idea that has been floated by some scientists and governments as a way to enable people who fight off the disease to return to work. On April 24, the World Health Organization discouraged that, saying, “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID -19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. The other study by Barouch's researchers involved 35 monkeys — 25 vaccinated against the virus and 10 that weren't. The vaccinated monkeys received one of six prototypes of DNA vaccines developed by his lab for the experiment. Each monkey got two doses. To provoke an immune response, each prototype used the genetic code for portions of the protein that scientists believe the coronavirus uses to invade cells. None of the prototypes are among dozens of experimental vaccines that have been developed by drug companies for testing in humans.", "annotations": [{"label": 19, "start_offset": 399, "end_offset":

{"id": 1941, "text": "The changes weren't shown to most lawmakers before the vote. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) appeared to address the criticism in a statement Tuesday in which she said she would continue to push for expanded leave, including for healthcare workers and those who need longer leave because they get sick. During negotiations, the Democratic House will continue to make clear to the Administration that any emergency response package must put Families First before any aid to corporate America is considered, she said in a statement. The bill passed Saturday morning allowed businesses with fewer than 50 workers to win exemptions under rules to be developed by the Labor Department. Many businesses had expressed concerns about cash flow and had also worried that they might suffer additional disruptions during a crisis by losing workers on whom they relied. The new measure also provides the labor secretary additional discretion to exclude emergency responders and health-care workers from the initial two weeks of emergency paid sick leave required under the bill. Health-care employers, such as nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, had warned lawmakers the original legislation could lead to a shortage of health-care workers just as coronavirus cases are surging in the U.S. The mandate applies only to companies with fewer than 500 employees, and sets up a mechanism for the government to reimburse through a tax credit employers who pay workers' wages while they are absent. But industry groups and GOP lawmakers have warned that firms may not have enough cash to keep up with payments as they grapple with virus-related disruptions, including falling revenue and worker shortages. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the government is prepared to advance the funds to businesses that can't cover the costs now. To become law, the legislation must next pass the Senate, where some Republicans have raised concerns that the legislation places too much of a burden on small employers. Many Democratic senators have pushed Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to take up the legislation, citing the urgency of the pandemic. The legislation also makes coronavirus testingfree and increases access to food assistance to those who need it. President Trump also suggested Monday that the White House could seek changes to the legislation to expand paid sick-leave coverage. He later added that the Senate is working well with the House.", "annotations": [{"label": 17, "start_offset": 61, "end_offset": 100, "user": 5, "created_at": "2021-04-20T23:57:45.197879Z",

{"id": 1931, "text": "We have seen by now that having President Trump at these briefings will result in tangents at best and misinformation at worst, which will subsequently have to be cleaned up by his team. Rather, let's hear from the scientists themselves. Let the public in on what's going on. On Monday, the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis revealed that the coronavirus task force had been giving private weekly reports to governors about hot spots and areas of concern. Such information should not be kept secret from the public, which needs it to make decisions such as whether to send kids back to school. Also, the better people understand the situation in their communities, the more likely they are to comply with recommendations such as mask mandates. Engage experts. There are growing calls to establish an independent commission to evaluate vaccine data. I'm not sure I like this because of the precedent it sets: What happens in the future if there is an administration that is actually listening to the science but an obstructionist Congress that misuses this structure? There is another path. The CDC, the FDA and other entities can work to engage experts outside of the federal government. There are many public health leaders in academia, industry and local and state government who seek assurance that decisions are based on scientific rigor and not political expediency.

It looks like a mini retro front-load washing machine, which makes it a little more interesting than the other solid square devices. It’s made for rooms up to 361-square feet – the size of an average bedroom – and can deal with dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke, odors and other pollutants. Turned on high though, it’s too loud to run in my bedroom all night. Still, with it’s filter-change indicator, dirt-sensor, and red light that tells you when the air’s nasty, it’s still one of my favorite’s. For $299, I also really like and recommend Blueair’s Pure 211+ or Dyson’s Pure Cool TP01 air purifiers too. Both perform really well, look sleek, and add a little style to the otherwise “dorm refrigerator” square appliance look. Of the larger, higher-end models, one sent over by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation – Samsung’s Cube Air Purifier ($749) – is a solid upgrade for small or medium sized rooms (up to 310 square feet). It's voice enabled, Wi-Fi connected, sports a higher-end metal design with a cool robotic feel, and it’s also certified as asthma and allergy friendly based on third-party testing.

After being hoarse for so long I was examined for nodes on my vocal cords while sucking down several packages of throat lozenges a week, I put the Molekule Air Mini ($399) right above where I sleep at night.

{"id": 1936, "text": "Unlike vaccines , Woodcock said, therapeutics have to be developed against multiple facets of the infection, including antiviral treatments that target the virus and medication that quells the out-of-control immune storm that causes the most-severe illness. In the short term, Woodcock urged Americans who have recently recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood plasma, rich with virus-fighting antibodies, to help other patients. We need donors. There are blood drives ongoing, and the U.S. government will be trying to accelerate these drives for convalescent plasma, Woodcock said. We need to get the word out nationally, this is something people can do. I think people feel very helpless in the face of this — and this is something everyone can contribute who has been infected. Although it is not yet clear whether the plasma transfusions are effective, they have been shown to be safe in vast numbers of patients and evidence suggests they may help, particularly if given to hospitalized patients early in the disease. Convalescent plasma has been viewed as a bridge to the development of pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines , but there is a relatively narrow window for donation, six to eight weeks after illness, which limits the ability to make transfusions widely available. Woodcock also emphasized the prospects for monoclonal antibodies, biotechnology drugs that can block the coronavirus and that are moving into large-scale trials this summer, in hopes of determining whether they are effective by fall. Monoclonal antibodies can be used as a treatment or a preventive measure that may be of particular utility in groups of people who don't respond as well to vaccines , such as older people. Last week, the federal government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority announced a $450 million investment to scale up production of experimental monoclonal antibody drugs being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , a New York company. That will help the company produce 70,000 to 300,000 doses of the treatment, depending on what final dose is shown to be effective. In addition, there are at least 50 monoclonal antibody drugs in development, Woodcock said. But with the United States reporting more than 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day, the demand for treatments could quickly outstrip the supply. Obviously, we are trying to get as many doses available as possible, for as many people, Woodcock said.", "annotations": [{"label": 17, "start_offset": 18, "end_offset": 26, "user": 5, "created_at":

{"id": 1938, "text": "Bright testified that his repeated warnings to stock up on masks and other crucial supplies to battle the virus were met with “indifference and “excuses when he began sounding the alarm in mid-January. He said that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield ignored his request for virus samples from China in January, slowing the development of treatments and vaccines . Bright, an immunologist who rose through the ranks of the federal agency after he joined in 2010, was reassigned to a lower-level role in the government after he resisted the administration's push to widely distribute the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in late March. The drug was not proven safe or effective to treat coronavirus , Bright argued. He was given a less important role in the National Institutes of Health in April. Trump again touted the supposed benefits of hydroxychloroquine on Thursday, which studies have not shown to be effective in treating the virus. “We have the world's greatest scientists, let us lead, Bright testified to the room full of masked lawmakers on a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, flanked by a bottle of Lysol wipes. “Let us speak without fear of retribution. Some Republicans on the panel asked why Bright did not go to the Health and Human Services Department inspector general or bring his concerns to Congress earlier, while others questioned why he did not personally raise concerns about the lack of adequate masks before January. (That inspector general has been ordered replaced after angering Trump with a report on mask shortages.) The soft-spoken Bright defended himself calmly, and revealed he was being treated for high blood pressure due to the stress of losing his job and becoming a whistle-blower. Later, mask manufacturer Mike Bowen, who testified after Bright about the mask shortage problem, defended the doctor. “I'm a Republican. I voted for President Trump and I admire Dr. Bright, Bowen testified.", "annotations": [{"label": 17, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 6, "user": 5, "created_at": "2021-04-19T23:44:51.085344Z",

Susan Bennett Lexington, Mass. ‘Ugly Acts of Subjugation’ by the Police To the Editor: Re “Video Shatters Public’s Image of Hoops Cop” (front page, Aug. 16): Thank you for this important portrait of Officer Bobby White, who gained national attention for playing basketball with local youths. As an organization that offers training programs for police officers, youths and parents, we often see law enforcement officers who are positive when children are compliant and grateful. But it’s when officers can’t get immediate compliance that you see their true mettle. Officers who commit ugly acts of subjugation to obtain deference to their authority reveal to youth that questioning authority often leads to use of force or assertion of police power or both. Officer White may have acted like a mentor to young boys in Gainesville, Fla. But it appears that he and many of his colleagues were trained to assume deference and rely upon arrest, handcuffs, threats and violence to get it. That means there’s always the chance they will revert to that training in any given situation, exactly as Officer White did in the second video, and no amount of basketball playing will improve that.

The virus has killed more than 227,000 people in the United States, but it has hit some communities harder than others. Blacks and Hispanics are nearly three times as likely as Whites to contract the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control . And African Americans are more than twice as likely to die of it. Don't let it take over your lives, Trump said during his triumphal homecoming video.

{"id": 1943, "text": "The teams had spent weeks collecting antibodies from mice exposed to the coronavirus 's spike protein, in hopes that two of the antibody molecules could be combined into a drug able to stop an infection. They also gathered antibodies from the blood of recovered coronavirus patients. Experiments to see whether these killed the virus in test tubes were being finished up that March Saturday. You can come now, Dr. Kyratsous texted Dr. Yancopoulos at 2:45 p.m. Dr. Yancopoulos got off a conference call and walked to the lab. As he entered the lab and saw Dr. Kyratsous smiling, he texted a colleague to bring a bottle of champagne. Data showed they had found hundreds of antibodies that blocked the virus from entering cells. If it couldn't enter cells, it couldn't replicate. A treatment was still far away -- but now was in sight. The champagne popped open. My head was in a rush: 'We've got it,' Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer recalls thinking after his chief scientific officer gave him the details. The world is starting to fall apart, and if we can just hold on, in that lab, in those tubes, is a cure. Regeneron said it would choose the best two antibodies for a drug in April and start clinical trials by early summer. It is preparing to make hundreds of thousands of doses a month by the summer's end. Getting the drug on the market isn't assured. Clinical trials showing the treatment is both effective and safe could take months.", "annotations": [{"label": 17, "start_offset": 410, "end_offset": 424, "user": 3, "created_at":

{"id": 1944, "text": "HHS officials also said they were unaware that the FDA began requiring emergency use authorizations, a kind of temporary approval, for laboratory-developed tests in February, after Azar declared a public health emergency. FDA supporters said the agency has followed the same practice during previous public health emergencies, including the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the Zika outbreak in 2015 and 2016. They stressed that it is critical during health emergencies to make sure tests are accurate and not fraudulent. The tests affected are those developed by and used at laboratories regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program, which is overseen by HHS 's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Such labs are in big academic medical centers, smaller commercial laboratories and big outfits such as Quest and LabCorp . By contrast, tests manufactured by one company — such as Roche and Abbott, for example — and sold to labs and other firms are still regulated by the FDA and aren't affected by the change. The FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests has long been a gray area. Technically, such tests include all those designed, manufactured and used within a single lab. But lab experts said there is no hard-and-fast definition. For years, the FDA has asserted authority over the tests but acted on it primarily during health crises. During the Obama administration, the FDA proposed tighter regulation in nonemergencies, a move that drew intense opposition from labs. But it didn't implement the plan. However, during public health emergencies, the FDA requires developers of the tests to seek an emergency use authorization that allows regulators to review the tests for accuracy. Some FDA backers inside and outside government worry the policy change may be a way to blame the agency for the February testing debacle that set the United States behind and allowed the virus to spread undetected for weeks. In February, the administration was relying almost entirely on a test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which is standard practice during public health crises — but the test was faulty.", "annotations": [{"label": 17, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 13, "user": 3, "created_at": "2021-04-21T04:18:30.273762Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-21T04:18:30.273797Z"}, {"label":

{"id": 1945, "text": "I'm not sure taking temperatures is all it's cracked up to be because there are a lot of false negatives and false positives, he said. It's best to just question people: 'Do you have any symptoms? Have you been near someone who is infected?' The time spent asking a couple of simple questions is probably more effective than just taking temperatures. In spite of all the precautions now in place, Joseph Khabbaza, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the Cleveland Clinic , said flying offers the most potential of travel activities for exposure to the coronavirus , because of the nature of how planes are configured. Once you're in the cabin, you don't know who's on the plane, he said. You're in relative closer proximity to people you don't know. Still, he said, flying is safer than it was earlier in the pandemic because of the changes airlines have made. In addition to spacing and sanitizing, he said, face masks add an extra layer of protection from the virus. Most U.S. carriers now require passengers to wear them. Airlines, airports, the Transportation Security Administration and others have touted intensive new cleaning measures and safety protocols including mask requirements, social distancing, plexiglass partitions at ticket and gate counters and other precautions in a bid to protect employees and lure skittish vacation and business travelers back. But cases have spiked, and based on recent earnings reports, airlines are still struggling. United said Tuesday that it will operate at barely over one-third of capacity through September. United CEO Scott Kirby said that demand has taken a step backward in July from where it was in mid-June, but it now seems to have bottomed. We expect we're kind of back to where we were in late May and that demand will start to gradually recover once again as we get through the rest of the year, he said.", "annotations": [{"label": 17,
