{"id": 2596, "text": "Children are not immune We all took comfort in initial reports that children seemed to be largely impervious to severe illness from COVID -19. It remains true that rates of severe illness and death from the virus are much lower among youths compared to adults. But our understanding of this virus is still evolving. This month, for example, we learned that about 100 children in New York and New England have been severely sickened — and at least three children have died — from a multiorgan inflammatory illness linked to the coronavirus . Coronavirus : My husband's nursing home did everything it could, but we still lost him Evidence also strongly suggests that children can actively spread the virus after they contract it, even in the absence of symptoms. Moreover, fall school openings pose a potential major threat to the gains in controlling spread of the virus. For all of these reasons, it is critical to consider children’s role as we progress toward building broad immunity across our society. So how can we reformulate our approach to this pandemic to put children at the heart of the response? Breaking the chain of transmission First, as schools and daycare centers reopen, we need to put robust screening and testing in place to monitor the spread of the virus. Household interactions are an established transmission route for the coronavirus , and we need to reduce the chance of children bringing the virus home with them. We will need to rapidly identify any hotspots in viral transmission at schools and daycare centers to prevent reigniting community spread. For that to succeed, schools will need protocols for how to respond when active cases surface. These plans should include recommendations for confirmatory tests, isolation practices and following the contacts of positive test cases. The guidelines must be careful to not promote absenteeism amongst specific groups of children, further widening disparities in education. Second, this pandemic will end either with widespread herd immunity or distribution of a safe and effective vaccine that drives case numbers close to zero.", "annotations": [{"label": 23, "start_offset": 44, "end_offset": 62, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.916233Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.916259Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 67, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.918178Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.918212Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 68, "end_offset": 141, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.919101Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.919122Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 341, "end_offset": 343, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.920257Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.920279Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 344, "end_offset": 356, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.921788Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.921810Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 357, "end_offset": 538, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.922625Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.922643Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 628, "end_offset": 636, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.923426Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.923444Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 637, "end_offset": 664, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.924241Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.924259Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 665, "end_offset": 759, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.924996Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.925013Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Share Your Thoughts What should Facebook and other social-media giants be doing, if anything, to reduce polarization among their users? Join the conversation below. In keeping with Facebook 's commitment to neutrality, the teams decided Facebook shouldn't police people's opinions, stop conflict on the platform, or prevent people from forming communities. The vilification of one's opponents was the problem, according to one internal document from the team. We're explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people's beliefs, one 2018 document states. We're focused on products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the 'other side.' Hot-button issues One proposal sought to salvage conversations in groups derailed by hot-button issues, according to the people familiar with the team and internal documents. If two members of a Facebook group devoted to parenting fought about vaccinations , the moderators could establish a temporary subgroup to host the argument or limit the frequency of posting on the topic to avoid a public flame war. Another idea, documents show, was to tweak recommendation algorithms to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups than people would ordinarily encounter. Building these features and combating polarization might come at a cost of lower engagement, the Common Ground team warned in a mid-2018 document, describing some of its own proposals as antigrowth and requiring Facebook to take a moral stance. Taking action would require Facebook to form partnerships with academics and nonprofits to give credibility to changes affecting public conversation, the document says. This was becoming difficult as the company slogged through controversies after the 2016 presidential election. People don't trust us, said a presentation created in the summer of 2018.

Buckee thinks that if the country doesn't alter the trajectory it is on, more shutdowns are inevitable. “I can't see a way that we're going to have restaurants and bars open in the winter, frankly. We'll have resurgence. Everything will get shut down again. Fauci favors a reset of the reopening measures, with a strong messaging component aimed at explaining to people why driving down transmission now will pay off later. Young people, in particular, need to understand that even if they are less likely to die from COVID -19, statistically speaking, transmission among twentysomethings will eventually lead to infections among their parents and grandparents, for whom the risk of severe infections and fatal outcomes is higher. (Young people can also develop long-term health problems.)", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

And it has worked. He rammed through Congress a corporate tax cut that reduced the corporate income-tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, providing an immediate, and lasting, boost to corporate profits. Since most stock prices trade as a function of a company’s profitability, giving those profits an immediate 14 percentage-point bump with a stroke of the pen succeeded in driving stock prices up. (On Feb. 12, the Dow reached a record high.) Mr. Trump is also on a relentless mission to get the Fed to keep interest rates low — again as a way of convincing investors they can get a better return on their money in the stock market — and that tactic has worked too. After raising short-term interest rates four times in 2018, Mr. Powell lowered them repeatedly in 2019, after a talking-to from the president. And now Mr. Powell seems poised to lower them again. But a little perspective is in order. The stock market was begging for a reason to correct. Since its low, in March 2009, the Dow had increased to nearly 30,000, from 6,500, a more than fourfold increase in 11 years. The spread of the coronavirus has given investors the excuse they needed to take the profits and run. It also gives Mr. Trump something to blame for what surely was an inevitable fall in stock market, other than himself and his economic policies, which have increased the national debt to more than $23 trillion, the annual budget deficit to more than $1 trillion and widened the gulf between rich and poor in this country to the largest spread since the Gilded Age. And while people are focusing on last week’s sudden drop, it is easy to forget that on Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow fell 22.6 percent in one day, before starting a long recovery. Last week looks like a piker by comparison.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

{"id": 2598, "text": "It allows federal partners to get a glimpse of how the states are planning to operationalize the blueprint. Experts say a vaccine probably won't be widely available to the public until at least the middle of 2021. A limited number of vaccine doses may be available as soon as November, but those will be prioritized for certain groups, such as health-care workers. The plans due Friday are supposed to address 15 topics, including how jurisdictions will ensure critical populations have access to vaccination sites; manage cold chain requirements while transporting and storing vaccines ; and build public confidence in and dispel misinformation about the vaccination process. We do want people to understand this is in fact a draft, D.C. Health Director LaQuandra S. Nesbitt told the D.C. Council on Wednesday. We don't yet have a vaccine , we don't yet know what storage and handling requirements will be. District officials began discussing how to distribute a vaccine in May, and assembled a vaccine planning team in June, which meets biweekly or as needed, the health department said in written responses to emailed questions. The department also created a scientific advisory committee to counsel Nesbitt on ways to encourage vulnerable residents to trust a vaccine once it is available. A lot of our discussions are aimed around ensuring that there is great vaccine confidence in those groups who are the ones who should be prioritized initially, she said at a news briefing Wednesday. Cold-storage requirements could range from vaccines that simply need to be refrigerated or kept frozen to those that need to be kept at ultracold temperatures, according to the CDC's 57-page playbook that was offered to states on Sept. 16. City officials say they have drawn on lessons learned from the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, and on planning for the influenza pandemic, in drawing its blueprint. At a scientific advisory committee meeting on Oct. 8, Nesbitt said officials are concerned that the federal government may provide vaccine allocations based on a jurisdiction's population, instead of the number of health-care workers based there. That approach could mean there are not enough vaccines for all of the doctors, nurses and front-line health workers in the city, many of whom live in Maryland and Virginia, she said. We don't quibble about testing residents from Maryland or Virginia who work here, because we can just put more money into that, Nesbitt said during the meeting. But I can't put more money into buying more vaccines .", "annotations": [{"label": 23, "start_offset": 108, "end_offset": 115, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.948747Z", "updated_at":

{"id": 2599, "text": "Without an additional $1 trillion in federal rescue efforts, the economy later this year will relapse into a double-dip recession, he added. Some of the damage that the pandemic has done to the economy will be lasting as business bankruptcies rise and the economy's long-run potential growth rate shrinks, according to Goldman Sachs . The bounceback isn't as quick as the downdraft, said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Mellon. The coronavirus recession has emerged as a distinctive blend of problems with both production and consumption. Initially, the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan, China, resulted in the closure of countless Chinese factories and interrupted international travel, threatening the ability of multinational companies to operate. That break in the global economy's ability to supply products soon evolved into an unprecedented fall in demand, as shutdowns spread to companies that had not been directly affected at first, depressing total output and employment, according to a new paper by economists at the University of Chicago , Northwestern University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University . The pandemic shock is different from other shocks, said Veronica Guerrieri, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and one of the paper's authors. The pandemic punched a hole in the U.S. economy that will measure nearly $800 billion in the second quarter alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office . The shortfall is reflected in tens of millions of newly unemployed workers cutting back on purchases while companies such as Howmet reduce spending on plants and equipment. Howmet is a major engine of the local economy in Whitehall, supporting eateries like Pekadill's, car dealers, hotels, and a number of tool and die shops. Howmet employees are regular customers at Pekadill's, sitting at the wooden booths inside the building, which dates to 1873, or in the well-tended garden out back. The company also was a steady source of catering orders for sales meetings and special functions, which sometimes meant more than 1,000 lunch orders. For Dillivan, the first domino tumbled at the end of January when United Airlines announced it was halting flights from the United States to China, after the novel coronavirus caused demand for tickets to evaporate. The next domino fell within weeks, as United - its revenue cratering - deferred orders for dozens of new Boeing aircrafts and said it would be in no rush to buy the additional planes it once planned. Fewer new aircraft means fewer new jet engines, including those containing turbine frames and airfoils manufactured by Howmet.", "annotations": [{"label": 25, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 129, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.980397Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.980413Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 131, "end_offset": 133, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.981128Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.981143Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 134, "end_offset": 139, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.981896Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.981912Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 141, "end_offset": 304, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.982658Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.982675Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 306, "end_offset": 318, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.983739Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.983756Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 319, "end_offset": 332, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.984533Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.984550Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 335, "end_offset": 381, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.985518Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.985535Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 383, "end_offset": 387, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.986326Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.986343Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 388, "end_offset": 435, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.987220Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.987239Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 760, "end_offset": 991, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.988042Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.988060Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 992, "end_offset": 1004, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.988834Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.988853Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1005, "end_offset": 1152, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.989631Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.989647Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1155, "end_offset": 1204, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.990414Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.990430Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1206, "end_offset": 1210, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.991190Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.991208Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1211, "end_offset": 1272, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.991963Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.991978Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1330, "end_offset": 1444, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.992725Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.992742Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1445, "end_offset": 1457, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.993534Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.993550Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1458, "end_offset": 1489, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.994741Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.994760Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 2133, "end_offset": 2136, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.995683Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.995701Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 2137, "end_offset": 2145, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.996923Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.996943Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 2147, "end_offset": 2347, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.997884Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.997903Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 2387, "end_offset": 2393, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.998797Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.998816Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 2475, "end_offset": 2479, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.999781Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:27.999799Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 2479, "end_offset": 2547, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.003279Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.003518Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The coronavirus outbreak presented Mr. Jones with yet another opportunity to monetize fear and deception, said Letitia James, the state attorney general, who issued her order on Thursday. “As the coronavirus continues to pose serious risks to public health, Alex Jones has spewed outright lies and has profited off of New Yorkers’ anxieties,” Ms. James, a Democrat said, adding that Mr. Jones’s claims are “incredibly dangerous.” In a statement on Friday, Jonathan W. Emord, a lawyer for “The Alex Jones Show” — the radio program — and Infowars called the allegations “false” and said the products were never intended “to be used in the treatment of any disease, including the novel coronavirus .” Mr. Emord said a prominent disclaimer would be posted on the website to make that explicitly clear. On Monday, the Trump administration issued warning letters to seven companies that were selling fraudulent coronavirus products including teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silvers, and ordered them to take corrective measures within 48 hours. The government also delivered a warning to “The Jim Bakker Show,” which is hosted by the disgraced tele-evangelist Jim Bakker, for allegedly selling products labeled to contain silver and misleadingly saying they could treat and cure the coronavirus . Last week, Ms. James also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Bakker’s show to stop allowing the sale of colloidal silver — in which small flakes of silver are suspended in fluid — after a guest claimed that it could “eliminate” the disease within 12 hours. Colloidal silver is not safe or effective to treat any disease or symptoms, according to the Food and Drug Administration . It can even be dangerous to a person’s health, the National Institutes of Health has said. Another company that received a warning from the federal government, Colloidal Vitality L.L.C., purportedly marketed oils on Facebook with descriptions such as, “So it’s actually widely acknowledged in both science and the medical industry that ionic silver kills coronaviruses.” Joseph J. Simons, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement that “what we don’t need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims.” The federal government has begun to crack down on products that claim to cure or prevent Covid -19, the disease the coronavirus causes, through a surveillance program that monitors the internet for fraudulent sales. So far, a federal task force has helped remove more than three dozen listings of at least 19 products. It has urged online marketplaces and major retailers to police its listings. EBay recently said it would ban face masks and hand sanitizer listings altogether, while Amazon recently notified sellers that it was no longer accepting requests to sell masks, sanitizers, disinfecting wipes and sprays, among other products. And social media platforms including Facebook , which had struggled to curtail misinformation about the virus on its website, announced bans on ads that promise to cure the illness. Government officials are also tackling the price gouging of products that can help reduce the risk of falling ill with the disease, such as hand sanitizer and face masks.", "annotations": [{"label":

{"id": 2601, "text": "They're coming down now, so that's a good sign, he said, adding that the decline in hospitalizations was the most objective near-term measure of the state of the epidemic. But as we head into September and October - kids return to school, people are starting to return to work - we're likely to see infections start to go back up again, and we know that hospitalizations lag infections. The country has reported at least 1,000 deaths per day for most of the past six weeks, pushing the U.S. death toll far beyond what officials optimistically predicted in the early stages of the pandemic. California, Florida and Texas still regularly tally more than 100 deaths daily, even as those states have reported progress in slowing the spread of new cases. Some smaller states, including Georgia, Arizona and Louisiana, have added several dozen deaths per day on average over the past month. After declining for weeks, daily deaths started rising again in early July, lagging several weeks behind the wave of cases that swept across the South and the West the previous month. This marked a change from earlier in the pandemic, when deaths followed infections more closely. Health experts say the longer time lag probably was the result of expanded testing, earlier diagnoses and young, healthy people passing on the virus to older, more vulnerable adults, who died later of their infections. The most concerning trend, Gottlieb said, was an uptick in cases in rural parts of the country, where outbreaks could quickly overwhelm local health-care systems. They don't have the same kinds of hospitals and the same kinds of resources to deal with an epidemic like this, he said. Infections trended upward over the past week in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas, and have flatlined in Illinois and Wisconsin, according to The Post's tracking. Iowa recorded the biggest jump, with per capita infections rising 106 percent over the past week and daily cases topping 1,000 for several days straight. Until last week, the state was reporting about 500 cases per day on average and had never reported more than 900 in a day. The spike was attributable to a combination of factors, including outbreaks at the University of Iowa and Iowa State, said Jorge Salinas, a hospital epidemiologist at the University of Iowa health-care system. More than 600 students at the University of Iowa and 130 students, faculty and staff members at Iowa State have tested positive since the academic year began in mid-August, according to the schools.", "annotations": [{"label": 25, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 46, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.052738Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.052754Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 51, "end_offset": 55, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.053523Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.053538Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 48, "end_offset": 50, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.054274Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.054303Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 68, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.055034Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.055049Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 170, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.055742Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.055757Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 678, "end_offset": 690, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.056471Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.056486Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 691, "end_offset": 704, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.057204Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.057221Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 705, "end_offset": 748, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.057962Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.057978Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1166, "end_offset": 1180, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.058785Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.058801Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1181, "end_offset": 1184, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.059522Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.059536Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1185, "end_offset": 1383, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.060303Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.060318Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1412, "end_offset": 1420, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.061042Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.061058Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1421, "end_offset": 1425, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.061806Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.061823Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1385, "end_offset": 1410, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.062536Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.062551Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1427, "end_offset": 1546, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.063274Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.063299Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1548, "end_offset": 1658, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.063996Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.064010Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1660, "end_offset": 1662, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.064728Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.064744Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1663, "end_offset": 1667, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.065576Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.065591Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 1669, "end_offset": 1812, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.066471Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.066486Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 1814, "end_offset": 1826, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.067460Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.067475Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 1826, "end_offset": 1846, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.068203Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.068219Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 2125, "end_offset": 2241, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.068951Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.068968Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 2243, "end_offset": 2247, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.069709Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.069724Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 2248, "end_offset": 2333, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.070500Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.070514Z"}, {"label": 25, "start_offset": 2335, "end_offset": 2506, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.071251Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.071267Z"}, {"label": 24, "start_offset": 2508, "end_offset": 2520, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.072014Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.072030Z"}, {"label": 23, "start_offset": 2521, "end_offset": 2532, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.072756Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:48:28.072772Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2602, "text": "This is the period in time we were hoping to close the gap, and this makes it more of a challenge. Trump aides acknowledge that the president's illness has been unhelpful because it draws national attention to his administration's handling of the pandemic. They also say that the president being hospitalized undercuts what he views as his main attribute over Biden: That he appears stronger and tougher. Anytime the conversation is about coronavirus , it's not helpful for us, said a senior administration official, who like some others interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. Biden has sought to focus attention on the pandemic and present a contrast in leadership. For instance, he has committed to releasing the results of all his coronavirus tests, a contrast to the lack of transparency surrounding Trump's test results and medical history, both recent and past. Biden's campaign has prided itself in working to take a disciplined approach that resists shifting strategy based on news developments despite how significant they seem. His strategy to model best practices with the pandemic has drawn some criticism for being low-energy and casual, as if cosseting the candidate, but Biden's advisers see recent developments as affirming. Did we let it change our approach? No, senior adviser Anita Dunn said of the criticism. At the end of the day, we've made a fundamental decision to model what a president should do. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) said the past week has affirmed for many voters that this whole act is getting old. After Tuesday's debate, which was held in Cleveland, Ryan said, he heard that some residents of Youngstown, in his congressional district, took down their Trump signs and that some Republican voters stopped by Biden campaign sites to pick up signs. It was the debate, Ryan said.

{"id": 2603, "text": "Yet in the mostly white 29690 neighborhood about 20 miles north – and with a median household income more than $20,000 higher – the infection rate remains significantly lower at 72.4 per 10,000. The district's reopening plans include options for virtual learning as well as in-person attendance for one, two or five days a week. The county's transmission rate, hospital capacity and individual school outbreaks could influence which option is implemented, and officials will allow for individual schools to temporarily alter attendance plans if necessary, district superintendent W. Burke Royster wrote in an email. 'The pressure is tremendous' Wilson, the school administrators association president, sees the stress and weariness she feels reflected on fellow superintendents' faces during daily Zoom calls. Every path forward is shrouded in uncertainty; every viable option has a definite downside. The digital divide, the homework gap, ZIP code inequities – there's an ethical framework by which we have to make decisions about how to allocate time and resources, Wilson said. Conflicting expectations converge from all sides: There are parents advocating for school buildings to reopen, and teachers unions filing lawsuits to prevent it. Some school administrators are adamant about wearing masks; others are aligned against such a policy. Executive orders, political figures' proclamations and ever-evolving studies about how the virus affects different age groups complicate matters further. The pressure is tremendous, Wilson said. The superintendent's chair is a lonely chair, especially through COVID -19. The National Education Association is working toward solutions school officials can implement to alleviate some of those safety concerns while keeping low-income students and students of color from falling behind, said Becky Pringle, the union's vice president.

Job growth is going to come to a standstill in November and there's a good probability it will fall in December and January, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. There are about 6.4 million job openings and more than 20 million people on unemployment aid. Northwestern University economist Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach points out that Congress gave about two years of unemployment payments during the Great Recession to help families get by until more jobs became available. Right now, unemployment help for millions of Americans will stop at the end of this year, meaning they will get less than a year's worth of aid in this downturn. Some of us are worried if we can see our relatives safely, but for millions of people just making sure they have a place to live and food to put on the table is a very real and pressing concern, said Joseph Llobrera, director of research on food assistance at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .

Facebook also said it expects renewed attempts to evade detection and that it could update its content policies as needed. The QAnon conspiracy theory centers on the idea that a powerful group of child traffickers control the world and are undermining President Trump with the help of other elites and mainstream news outlets. Last year a Federal Bureau of Investigation field office warned that QAnon and other conspiracies could spark violence in the U.S., and QAnon adherents have discussed future plans to round up or kill members of the supposedly evil cabal. President Trump in August welcomed the support of QAnon followers and said while he knew little about the movement, he suggested those who subscribe to it are people who love our country. Social-media companies have received mixed reactions to their policies around rule violators, with some arguing that the companies are stifling free speech and others wanting them to take a tougher stance. LinkedIn , owned by Microsoft Corp ., has recently taken steps to remove QAnon posts with misleading information in response to more supporters going public on the career-networking platform. Twitter Inc . has also pledged to increase enforcement against QAnon conspiracy followers. Policing QAnon content is just one of the broad content-moderation issues that the world's largest social-media companies are facing. Platforms have been grappling with the spread of misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic as well as groups connected to the boogaloo movement. Its adherents views' are wide-ranging, with a focus on overturning authority, according to researchers who track extremist organizations. Facebook and Twitter both moved Tuesday to place limits on posts by President Trump in which he claimed the coronavirus isn't as deadly as the common flu.

In an about-face, Prime Minister Mark Rutte issued “strong advice” for people to wear masks inside public places. The Dutch authorities had long said that masks provided a false sense of security, emphasizing other forms of social distancing. Mr. Rutte said his government would seek to make them legally obligatory. The aversion to masks, experts say, could help explain why the Netherlands is suffering such a serious spike, despite being wealthy and well-organized, with one of the best health care systems in the world. It also has a lack of testing capacity, which has prompted the Dutch to consider hiring labs in Abu Dhabi. “Despite spending large amounts of money, they couldn’t get these things done,” said Sheila Sitalsing, a columnist for the newspaper De Volkskrant. “The problem is with our management, although of course also many ordinary people have ignored obvious health rules.” In Britain, which has suffered the greatest number of virus deaths in Europe, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has walked a tightrope between scientific advisers who are pushing for another nationwide lockdown and members of his Conservative Party who warn that such a draconian response would wreck the economy. On Monday, Mr. Johnson rolled out a three-tier system of restrictions. Though the government initially put only put hard-hit Liverpool in the highest-level tier, other cities, like Manchester, are likely to be added soon.

He also stressed that bar spaces will be available for food service “with the right distance measures in place.” Baker said that while bars and nightclubs remain closed in Massachusetts, evidence from other states clearly shows restaurants can safely use bar seating for food service when physical-distancing measures are in place. “What the governor has been saying — and he has insight into contact tracing — is that restaurants aren't the problem,” said Bob Luz, president of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association. The virus is spreading through parties and other social events.” Baker warned that the virus “is still with us” and until there's a medical breakthrough, such as a vaccine , officials must “do all we can to keep our restaurants and other businesses safe. “We hope these updates will also help Main Street” eateries and businesses, Baker said. Lou Saban, an attorney who represents restaurant industry workers, called the announcement “incredible news.” “If this causes every restaurant in Boston to hire one bartender, just think about what that would do for the economy and the working class,” he said. “I think that when bars were taken away, people began to realize how important they are to our culture — sitting at one, working behind one, and the feeling of community they grant.” Nino Trotta, who owns Libertine and Forcella in the North End, said he was hopeful that bar seating might make some sports fans go to a restaurant to watch a game instead of cozying up on the couch. But those working on behalf of independent restaurants say that this latest loosening of restrictions is still not enough to keep restaurants afloat. None of these changes is going to be dramatic enough to solve the problem, said Tony Maws, a cofounder of the group Mass Restaurants United, which held a rally outside of the State House on Tuesday. “We need economic relief. We need real support in the form of real dollars.” Baker was joined at the briefing by Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, who urged the public to shop and dine locally to support their communities. “We must continue to shop local, buy local, dine local,” Polito said. “These places make up the fabric and the culture of what people love about their community.” Baker, Polito, and others highlighted a grant program that supports nonprofits helping to improve downtown areas.

Now Signature, which has nearly 60 percent of its portfolio tied up in commercial real estate, is bracing for the fallout. The bank's bad-loan write-offs, though still modest, are creeping higher. Despite years of steady profits, investors have punished the stock, which even after a recent rebound has lost 27 percent of its value this year. If U.S. banks absorb big losses on their $2 trillion in commercial real estate loans, the entire economy will suffer. Just the fear of looming bankruptcies and defaults has prompted banks in recent months to restrict new lending, at a time when the virus-ravaged economy needs all the help it can get. Tighter credit standards make it harder for commercial borrowers to roll over old loans as they come due and could starve other businesses of capital needed to expand and hire more workers. If the economic downturn proves lengthy, mounting losses could even undermine financial stability, according to some Federal Reserve officials, economists and credit analysts. This is something that could make a bad situation worse, said Adam Slater, lead economist for Oxford Economics in London. What we don't want is to get really nasty stresses and strains in the financial system from something like this. Today's worries are grounded in history. Banks have repeatedly failed after stumbling into big losses on commercial real estate loans, from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s to the Great Recession in 2008. U.S. banks lost $110 billion on commercial real estate in the last financial crisis, at least one-quarter of their total losses, according to Oxford Economics. This time, the losses could be even worse, with the pandemic forcing a fundamental reconsideration of how Americans work, shop and live. With a highly contagious disease circulating in the country, tens of millions of people have been working for months from home, shopping online and only occasionally visiting shops and eateries.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Again, if the disease transmits like influenza, it appears that containment is all but impossible. Eventually, and more likely sooner rather than later, it will spread in countries around the world. The three most important remaining questions involve morbidity (what percentage of a population will get sick), virulence and how well humans develop an immune response. Since no solid numbers exist as to how many people have become infected — we only know how many have sought treatment and tested positive — we have no idea of the morbidity, and the current estimate of 2 percent case mortality is not reliable. Two percent is a frightening number if the disease spreads widely; that was the approximate case mortality for the 1918 influenza pandemic. We do, however, know that 11 percent to 15 percent of those hospitalized die — suggesting a lethality roughly double seasonal influenza, which kills anywhere from 3,000 to 61,000 Americans each year. Longer term, if this virus does become endemic, will a vaccine protect people against infection? Some vaccines , such as against measles, provide almost 100 percent protection. But the effectiveness of influenza vaccines varies year to year, and have ranged from 10 percent to 62 percent effective. That, in the long run, may be the most important unknown.

If you assume 75% of Americans take the vaccine , then the cost of the program would be $360 billion, which would be a relatively small percentage of any of the various proposals suggested. The American people need a second check and a vaccine stimulus gets it done. From a fiscal perspective the most important thing we can do is end the pandemic as soon as possible, so we don’t need a third or fourth relief bill. When we end the outbreak we decrease unemployment costs, decrease virus-related Medicare and Medicaid costs and increase federal revenues as businesses reopen and people start getting paychecks. It will likely have a much higher return on investment than other stimulus plans. We beat a pandemic recession by beating the pandemic, not by focusing on unrelated issues and problems.

House Republican leadership met Wednesday to discuss possible legislation, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) was in contact with Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday. Prospects of a bipartisan agreement have fallen to Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he would defer to the Trump administration and House Republicans indicated they would also fall in line behind the White House. Democrats and the administration agree on the need to expand paid sick leave as lawmakers worry about hourly-wage earners who may continue to go to work even if they contract the disease.

If the president is supporting it then he's going to have a big Republican vote in the house. Period, said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) The House Democratic plan calls for up to three months of paid leave for workers who are infected, in quarantine, taking care of children, or caring for a loved one who is sick, according to a congressional aide. It would replace two-thirds of wages with a $4,000 a month cap for workers not already receiving wages or paid leave, according to the aide. The plan also includes roughly $1 billion in assistance for nutrition programs, according to a person familiar with the proposal. White House officials were still reviewing the House proposal Wednesday night, but a person familiar with the matter said some officials in the building weren't keen on it.

Scientists are at work on those questions, trapping wildlife in China, taking fecal samples and blood, culturing viruses, sequencing genomes from bats, pangolins and humans, and comparing them, as the clock ticks. “Apollo’s Arrow,” by Nicholas Christakis, is a useful contribution to this initial wave of Covid books, sensible and comprehensive, intelligent and well sourced, albeit a little programmatic and dull. (Touching on past pandemics and epidemics, as well as our current crisis, the book takes its title from those terrible arrows, representing plague, that Apollo rained down on the Greeks in Book 1 of the “Iliad.”) It’s a broad survey, not a deep dive, and sweeps across most of the signal topics: the inept early responses to the outbreak, first in China and then in the United States; the back story of modern pandemics and pandemic threats, notably the 1918 influenza and SARS in 2003; the social shutdowns, the mask issue and the tension between civil liberties and public health; the grief, fear and lies that make a pandemic emotionally as well as medically punishing; the social and economic changes, forced by this virus, that may become permanent; the general question of how plagues end and the specific, more speculative question of how this one might. Given that Christakis is a physician and sociologist, the co-author of an earlier book about social networks and how they shape lives, the co-author also of an influential paper on “social contagion theory” and the co-director of the Institute for Network Science at Yale, one naturally expects that “network science” might afford him special insight into Covid -19. This book delivers on that expectation moderately, with a short section on the superspreader phenomenon and such disease-math variables as the basic reproduction number (the average number of persons infected by each infected person in a naïve population), the case fatality rate, the threshold for herd immunity and a few others that have become familiar in recent months. There’s also dispersion, less familiar, which is the variation in actual (not average) reproduction number from one infected person to another. If some people cause few secondary infections and some cause many, the dispersion is high. (The dispersion of Covid -19 is high.) Why? Although part of the answer may be that some individuals simply shed more virus, or wash their hands less, or refuse to wear masks or cough more, another contributor to superspreading, Christakis explains, is that certain people have many more social contacts than the average.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Now he's taking pains to emphasize that his new study, which is enraging leftist academics, does not say that Mr. Trump won but simply extrapolates from telephone survey data of GOP voters commissioned by a former Trump campaign official. Mr. Miller wrote in his declaration filed in court: The analysis was performed on a data set provided by Matt Braynard and his firm, External Affairs, Inc, and the analysis is predicated on the assumption that the responders are a representative sample of the population of registered Republicans in Pennsylvania for whom a mail-in ballot was requested but not counted, and responded accurately to the questions during the phone calls. As of November 16th, 2020, there were 165,412 mail-in ballots requested by registered PA Republicans that had not arrived to be counted. Around 18,000 people on this list were called and around 3000 answered up to four questions. These responses are used to estimate how many of these 165,412 ballots were requested by someone other than the named person, and to estimate how many of these ballots were mailed back but not received. • Estimate of how many of the 165,412 uncounted mail-in ballots were requested in the name of a registered Republican by someone other than that person: 40,875. • Estimate of how many of the 165,412 uncounted Republican ballots that the requester returned but were not counted: 44,892. For any Trump voters holding out hope that the results can be overturned, this is of course not the best time to appeal to the authority of a political poll. There's a question of whether the survey sample was truly representative of the target population. To be meaningful in assessing possible impact on the election outcome, such a survey would also need to include non-GOP voters as well. It's conceivable Democrats were treated even worse than Republicans. And of course in assessing the impact there's also the question of how many uncounted voters chose their own party's candidate.

In some cases, Brussels or European countries could block deals altogether. The measures would give European officials “very broad powers,” said Horst Henschen, a lawyer in the Frankfurt office of Covington, a law firm. Authorities could interfere with deals “based on the mere fact that the foreign company enjoys business advantages because it received subsidies or has access to preferential financing,” Mr. Henschen said in an email.

But what Trump suggests is that there is a type of inverse power to order more lax public health measures over state objections. Yet the pandemic rules were designed to ensure more protective health measures, not protect against them. Trump has alluded to a type of pan-economic power to force states to prioritize economics over pandemic concerns. Not only does no such express power exist, it would contradict core principles of our constitutional system. Federalism is a strength, not a weakness, in a pandemic, allowing highly tailored plans that are primarily administered by state and local officials, for better or worse. A 2015 New York State Department of Health report, for example, shows that New York, which has borne the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, received this warning, which wasn't adequately heeded: If an influenza pandemic on the scale of the 1918 pandemic were to occur, it is possible that New York would face a significant shortage of ventilators. The flip side of federalism is that, just as states decide how to prepare and act on a pandemic, they also get to decide when to stop such measures. Each state is allowed to balance the possible costs of a resurgence of cases against the costs of harming its economy by continuing public health measures. It is the ultimate policy decision, and it remains a state decision with likely different priorities in different states. Regardless of the state choice, however, a constitutional order imposed by a governor must be lifted by that governor. As president, Trump has the bully pulpit to argue that case, and many governors are likely to listen to him. By calling for the nation to reopen, he offers some political cover for governors who can rely on the federal guidance. The federal government can also threaten to extend or withhold forms of financial support or cooperation for states that oppose the federal plan — but that power is limited.

Rubella is more of an orphan virus because so few people work on it, said Roberto Cattaneo, a researcher and measles expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Cattaneo, who was not involved in the study, called it great work, adding I think this will sure help with understanding the fundamental virology of rubella. The discovery of the two rubella relatives may also aid efforts to develop a treatment for more than 100,000 babies around the world stricken each year with congenital rubella syndrome. The syndrome, in which the virus passes from mother to fetus during pregnancy, can result in the baby suffering loss of hearing, loss of sight, heart disease, or other birth defects. Many cases of congenital rubella syndrome result in stillbirths, miscarriages and fetal malformations. The last major epidemic of rubella in the U.S. took place in 1964 and 1965, infecting 12.5 million people and causing 11,000 pregnant women to lose their babies. The rubella vaccine was approved for widespread use in 1969, and infections then declined rapidly. In 2004, the Pan American Health Organization declared rubella eliminated from the U.S. The disease is no longer spread year-round in the Americas region or the United States. Still, the virus has remained a puzzle, and congenital rubella syndrome has remained a problem in other parts of the world.

More * Trump Suspends Interest on Student Loans But there will be disagreements over the best ways to accomplish the two goals and over just how large a stimulus may be necessary, as policy makers and economists grapple with how big a shock the virus will cause and how quickly the economy might rebound. And getting anything through a divided Congress will be a challenge. President Trump on Friday criticized the bill that Democrats and his administration have been working on, a sign of how difficult a larger package might be. Mr. Trump has been urging Congress to suspend payroll taxes for workers and employers through the end of the year. That would cut taxes by more than $800 billion, or 4% of gross domestic product. But that idea has gotten little traction in Congress because it wouldn't help people who aren't getting paid. Because a payroll tax cut is tied to earnings, it would also have limited benefits for many retail workers and other employees whose hours are cut. Many Democrats also say they are concerned that companies wouldn't pass payroll-tax cuts on to workers and that the money wouldn't get to people quickly enough because it is spread across each paycheck instead of in a lump sum. A payroll tax cut can be an effective tool, but it's not the best answer in this case, said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.). President Trump on March 6 signed an $8.3 billion bill funding efforts to develop a vaccine and assist local and state governments' responses. On Friday night, Democrats and the White House reached an agreement on legislation that would make coronavirus testing free and provide paid sick leave to many of those affected by the pandemic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on CNBC on Friday morning that the bill being considered by the House now is like the second inning in a nine-inning baseball game, with more to come. We will use whatever tools we need to make sure that the industries that are impacted by this get through this, Mr. Mnuchin said.

It is also one of a number of states where Republicans are trying to help Kanye West, the rapper and occasional Trump ally who has said he is running for president, fulfill requirements to get on the ballot, a move that many see as an effort to siphon Black votes away from Mr. Biden. Mr. West appeared to confirm this week in an interview with Forbes that he was trying to harm the former vice president. Mr. Biden, whose advisers believe can connect with the working-class white voters who bolstered Mr. Trump in 2016, remains an elusive target for the president. When Mr. Trump arrived in Ohio and gave a speech to a group of supporters, he accused Mr. Biden of trying to “hurt” the Bible and “hurt” God. “He’s against God,” Mr. Trump, who rarely attends church and has had trouble pointing to specific Bible verses that he likes, said, promptly obliterating whatever media attention his aides hoped an earlier remark that Mr. Biden had made about Black people would get. “He’s against guns. He’s against energy, our kind of energy. I don’t think he’s going to do too well in Ohio.” The remark prompted a swift rebuke from Mr. Biden’s campaign and, hours later, from the former vice president himself. Mr. Biden, a Catholic, described his faith as the “bedrock foundation of my life” that sustained him after he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident, and later, his adult son Beau Biden to cancer. “For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful,” Mr. Biden said, calling it “beneath the office he holds.” He added that the attacks “show us a man willing to stoop to any low for political gain, and someone whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings that he professes to believe in.” Mr. Trump maintained that Mr. Biden frequently is confused about his whereabouts, during a speech in which the president mispronounced Thailand as “Thighland,” catching himself a short time later. The president spoke as his aides struggled to get a deal for new legislation to help people suffering economic pain caused by the coronavirus , something Mark Meadows, his chief of staff, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have been scrambling to achieve in negotiations with Democratic leaders. Mr. Trump has not been a meaningful part of the talks, preferring to comment from the sidelines.

He declined to say on Friday whether he agreed with the views of a Republican candidate for the House, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has embraced the far-right QAnon theory. OAN's primary White House correspondent, Chanel Rion, is regularly called on by Trump and McEnany during briefings. The president has frequently praised the conservative cable network, finding it preferable to the much larger Fox News. At Thursday's briefing, Trump again called on Rion, who immediately deferred to Emel Akan of the Epoch Times. Akan asked how the United States would respond to the Chinese government's arrest of Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong media mogul, in an apparent crackdown on press freedom. Trump called it a terrible thing and then pivoted to a discussion of Hong Kong's economy, saying the withdrawal of unspecified U.S. incentives would make it very hard for Hong Kong to compete. He then ended the briefing. At Friday's news conference, Trump called on Gateway Pundit's representative, Alicia Powe, who asked Trump about his reaction to former vice president Biden taking credit for the peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.

At a briefing on April 8, Mr. Trump told reporters: I haven't left the White House in, I guess, months, other than to wave goodbye to a hospital ship leaving Virginia for New York in March. He last held a campaign rally on March 2. The president said he hoped to resume holding campaign rallies in the not-too-distant future, saying the timing and location of rallies would depend on the number of coronavirus cases in states. He said he wanted to see a good old-fashioned, 25,000-person rally without social distancing. I can't imagine a rally where you have every fourth seat full, every six seats are empty for everyone that you have full, he said. That wouldn't look too good.

A vaccine for the novel coronavirus is expected to come next year at the earliest.

While the spread of misinformation, largely through the media, carries much of the blame, those who embraced, enforced, or advocated for overly strict quarantine measures certainly fanned the flames. To gain public trust, health officials must be honest and transparent about what is and is not known about a disease outbreak, and provide useful recommendations for avoiding infection. Giving people credible information about what they can do is an important first step in facing an infectious disease outbreak. Asking people to protect themselves is necessary to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases like Covid -19, for which there yet is no vaccine or cure. But it isn't sufficient, because not everyone can comply with recommendations like social distancing, such as not going to school or work and avoiding places where others congregate. Following such recommendations is almost impossible for day laborers who don't get paid if they don't go to work; for people with low-wage jobs; for people who don't have paid sick leave; and others. For many Americans, a few days of lost wages can mean not being able to pay the rent, buy food, or afford medications. They may feel compelled to go to work even if they aren't feeling well, because they need the money. We need to make it possible for such individuals — who make up a large chunk of Americans — to stay home. That means providing some source of replacement income or job security, either through the private sector or the government. Would that be expensive? Yes.

Last week, a church official wrote to The Wall Street Journal saying leaders of the church were being detained and investigated despite their efforts to cooperate with authorities since the coronavirus outbreak began. With the church losing its license, it's an alarming development for religious freedom advocates, the official said. Mr. Lee, who is believed by church members to be immortal, founded Shincheonji in 1984. The group now claims it has more than 245,000 members world-wide, though about 21,000 are in South Korea where it has 1,100 venues. The national government in Seoul has called Shincheonji a Korean cult. The outbreak at a Shincheonji church in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city with 2.4 million people, proved to be a major complication for health investigators. Health authorities soon learned thousands of worshipers had knelt on the ground close to each other during services. Shincheonji members are told they must recruit followers to gain eternal life, meaning they had crossed paths with many other people at busy intersections or even in other towns. Many Shincheonji followers were hesitant to come forward, as some concealed their ties to the church to co-workers—and even their own families. In late February, the South Korea government ordered Shincheonji to close all of its facilities nationwide and halt gatherings. In the months since, legal challenges against Shincheonji and Mr. Lee have accumulated. A civic group accused Mr. Lee of embezzling church funds.

The oil market is finally coming to a balance soon with supply expected to match demand, Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at consulting firm Rystad Energy , said in a note. Brent crude futures, the global gauge of oil prices, advanced 1.8% to $36.17 a barrel Tuesday. Adding to the optimism: Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said during a recent videoconference that the energy ministry expects higher demand to balance the market in the next few months. Russia is part of a historic deal reached last month through which many large producers are lowering supply. Earlier in the year, a production feud between Russia and Saudi Arabia raised global output as demand crashed, causing the oil-price slide. U.S. crude started the year above $60. Producers are now slashing supply, with Saudi Arabia pledging to cut production to its lowest level since 2002 next month. Investors are looking ahead to a June meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies like Russia to gauge how long supply cuts might last.

Executive compensation experts and patient advocates were troubled by the idea of tying a massive payout to a short-term milestone. Drug companies like Novavax are getting billions of dollars from taxpayers to develop a COVID -19 vaccine , so it's certainly concerning to see their executives get massive payouts before we know if the vaccine actually works, Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for consumer watchdog Patients Over Pharma, told Reuters. The Trump administration awarded Novavax a $1.6 billion vaccine contract earlier this month as part of its Operation Warp Speed initiative. The deal with the publicly traded Maryland company, which has never brought a vaccine to market in its 33-year history, will cover late-stage clinical trials and secure 100 million doses of vaccine for the government. Novavax has said that it expects to have its vaccine ready for distribution by late 2020. According to the company's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Novavax awarded 140,000 stock options to John Trizzino, its senior vice president, chief business officer, chief financial officer and treasurer; 165,000 to Gregory Glenn, the president of research and development; and 125,000 to John Herrmann, senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary.
