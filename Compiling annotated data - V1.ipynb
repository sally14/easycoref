       "'Hong Kong, with a population of around 7.5 million, had a total of 6,039 cases and 108 deaths as of Saturday, a low rate for any city. But the region’s recent setbacks underscore the challenges that the world will continue to face until there is a widely available vaccine . As cases have soared back to alarming levels in recent weeks, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong have had to quickly recalibrate their strategies. Travel bubbles that were announced with great fanfare are now on hold. Weeks after reopening, schools have been shut again. Bars and restaurants are closing early or shifting to takeaway menus. “We need solidarity in this kind of situation, but as everyone knows, it’s not easy,” said Dr. Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University in Seoul .'"

       "\"Social distancing restrictions meant some senators, Fauci and other witnesses participated by video conference from their homes and officers. Several senators attended the Washington hearing in person, but GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander led the meeting from his home in Tennessee. Here are six key points from the hearing: Fauci: Ignoring guidelines may lead to 'suffering and death' Fauci said not following federal guidelines such as testing people for infection, tracing their contacts and isolating them to prevent the disease from spreading could lead to some suffering and death” that could be avoided. Guidelines to states include waiting until cases have declined for at least two weeks before easing restrictions. Communities also have to be capable of adequately responding when the virus inevitably returns, he said. HEROES Act: Democrats' $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus proposal includes more $1,200 checks, money for state and local governments But Fauci warned that if states reopen without precautions, it presents a “real risk that you will trigger an outbreak,” which could hurt the economy again. “You can almost turn the clock back, rather than going forward,” he said. “That is my main concern.” Fauci on coronavirus : 'We don’t have it completely under control' Despite declines in infections and hospitalizations in some areas, Fauci warned about spikes and said the virus is nowhere near being contained. “We don’t have it completely under control,” he told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., criticized the contrast between health experts warning about the dangers of opening states too early mere hours after Trump said the country prevailed against the virus. “This is infuriating to many of us because it comes hours after the president declared that we have prevailed over coronavirus , which I’m just going to tell you is going to make it harder on state leaders to keep social distancing restrictions in place,” he said. Trump promoted the country’s testing Monday in a Rose Garden news conference, saying the 9 million tests so far made America a worldwide leader. “We have met the moment, and we have prevailed,” said Trump, who later said he meant the country prevailed on testing. Trump going to PA: Donald Trump to visit Allentown, Pennsylvania factory as he pushes message on reopening Murphy also slammed the lack of detailed federal guidance as states begin to reopen. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said state officials could contact his agency with their questions. He said nationwide recommendations are under review and would be released soon. Murphy said soon wasn't good enough. “You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance that you have given us,” Murphy said. “Then the guidance you have provided is criminally vague.” Fauci: Finding a vaccine 'definitely not a long shot' Fauci expressed optimism Tuesday that a vaccine will be found for the coronavirus within a year or two. His confidence stemmed from the fact that most people can fight off the virus themselves, offering scientists an opportunity to devise a way to get the body to combat it better. “It’s definitely not a long shot,” Fauci said.\""

As cases have soared back to alarming levels in recent weeks, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong have had to quickly recalibrate their strategies. Travel bubbles that were announced with great fanfare are now on hold. Weeks after reopening, schools have been shut again. Bars and restaurants are closing early or shifting to takeaway menus. “We need solidarity in this kind of situation, but as everyone knows, it’s not easy,” said Dr. Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University in Seoul .'"
