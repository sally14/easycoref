0,"Hong Kong, with a population of around 7.5 million, had a total of 6,039 cases and 108 deaths as of Saturday, a low rate for any city. But the region’s recent setbacks underscore the challenges that the world will continue to face until there is a widely available vaccine . As cases have soared back to alarming levels in recent weeks, South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong have had to quickly recalibrate their strategies. Travel bubbles that were announced with great fanfare are now on hold. Weeks after reopening, schools have been shut again. Bars and restaurants are closing early or shifting to takeaway menus. “We need solidarity in this kind of situation, but as everyone knows, it’s not easy,” said Dr. Kim Woo-joo, an infectious disease specialist at Korea University in Seoul .","Governors and health officials tell us that there is a profound gap between the protective equipment, hospital equipment and testing resources that are needed (and will be needed) and what is available (or in the pipeline). Bill Gates reminds us that we will need to produce millions, perhaps billions, of doses of vaccine [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bill-gates-heres-how-to-make-up-for-lost-time-on-covid-19/2020/03/31/ab5c3cf2-738c-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html] in 12 to 18 months. This isn’t a passing crisis; we will need more of everything in two months, six months and maybe years. Don’t let debate over the details of General Motors ’ and Ventec’s honorable effort to build more ventilators[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/gm-ventilators-coronavirus-trump.html] hide the bottom line: The federal government has all the authority it needs to close the supply gap, allocate resources among states, and prepare for the production and distribution of the vaccine to come. Until the federal government demonstrates — with statistics, contracts and timelines — that the gap is closed and the vaccine pipeline is ready, we should ask: Why isn’t the government bringing its full arsenal to the fight? The D.P.A.’s authorities[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IN11231.pdf] go beyond prioritizing contracts and manufacturing supplies. Its allocation authority addresses the problem of states’ competing against one another for scarce resources based on market mechanisms. The federal government can allocate equipment and supplies based on actual need and best public-health practices. The D.P.A.’s industry assessment authority can be used to measure production and distribution capacity, remove blind spots, plan efficiently and recreate a supply chain at home. The federal government can determine now which entities could produce vaccines while it plans for their ethical allocation. The government can then use the D.P.A.’s Title III incentive authorities to issue loans, offer antitrust protection and guarantee purchases, creating a secure market for masks, tests and vaccines . The law is so broad in places that it is sometimes referred to as a “commandeering” authority. Lawyers prefer to say the president would act at the zenith of his authority under the paradigm presented in Justice Jackson’s concurrence[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/579] in the Supreme Court’s landmark Youngstown[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/] https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/] case[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/343/579/]. But its use is not as extraordinary as some suggest, and it is not commandeering. The Defense Department alone uses the prioritization authority some 300,000 times a year, while the government uses Title III incentives 20 to 30 times per year. Although the allocation authority has not been used since the Cold War[https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1582898704576-dc44bbe61cce3cf763cc8a6b92617188/2018_DPAC_Report_to_Congress.pdf], some civilian airliners and freighters remain allocated for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet. Nor does exercise of the prioritization and allocation authority equate to state ownership. Under the act, corporations are paid fair market value for their products. Any actual “commandeering” of production would require just compensation under the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause. Moreover, price controls under the D.P.A. require a joint resolution of Congress signed into law by the president. The D.P.A. also contains built-in safeguards. A majority of its provisions expire every five years. That is why it has been reauthorized by Congress over 50 times[https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R43767#page=6] since its passage in 1950. Congress can decline to do so or do so with amendments when the act comes up for reauthorization in 2025, or sooner. The law also gives federal courts jurisdiction over disputes including the power to determine and award fair market value and forbid the executive branch from using the statute improperly. If a business feels the government is overreaching or unrealistic in its timelines, it can seek relief in court and do so on an emergency basis. Finally, the government reports annually on the D.P.A.’s use: Not only will the Congress know how the act is used, the public will, too. What about liability? The first answer is to make equipment that works. The second answer is Title 42, giving the secretary of health and human services authority to determine that the coronavirus pandemic “constitutes a public health emergency[https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:247d-6d%20edition:prelim)],” recommend use of “covered countermeasures” to fight the pandemic and in doing so grant broad protection from liability under both state and federal law, except in the case of “willful misconduct.” There are other solutions as well, like special legislation, indemnification clauses to contracts, the government contract defense and, if all else fails, waivers. Here’s the big picture: In times of crisis, when lives are at stake, lawyers and policymakers are supposed to find solutions to problems — to get to yes with honor and within the law — and not to create obstacles. State and local authorities are imploring the federal government to use the authority it has to secure our medical supply chain. So far, the administration appears to have responded like a parent doling out candy to a child: one piece at a time. This is an “all hands on deck” moment, not merely to flatten the curve but to leap ahead of the curve. America was once the arsenal of democracy; the D.P.A. can help make us the arsenal of public health. If I were advising the president (or the secretaries with delegated authority), I would say this: Please, tell the public what the need is and how the need will be met today, next week and in the months to come. What specifically has been contracted for, in how many units and on what timeline? Where there is a gap between need and supply, use the D.P.A. to close it. I’ve never heard of a commander who complained about having too many tanks or who asked for a few artillery shells and not one too many.

1,"Social distancing restrictions meant some senators, Fauci and other witnesses participated by video conference from their homes and officers. Several senators attended the Washington hearing in person, but GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander led the meeting from his home in Tennessee. Here are six key points from the hearing: Fauci: Ignoring guidelines may lead to 'suffering and death' Fauci said not following federal guidelines such as testing people for infection, tracing their contacts and isolating them to prevent the disease from spreading could lead to some suffering and death” that could be avoided. Guidelines to states include waiting until cases have declined for at least two weeks before easing restrictions. Communities also have to be capable of adequately responding when the virus inevitably returns, he said. HEROES Act: Democrats' $3 trillion coronavirus stimulus proposal includes more $1,200 checks, money for state and local governments But Fauci warned that if states reopen without precautions, it presents a “real risk that you will trigger an outbreak,” which could hurt the economy again. “You can almost turn the clock back, rather than going forward,” he said. “That is my main concern.” Fauci on coronavirus : 'We don’t have it completely under control' Despite declines in infections and hospitalizations in some areas, Fauci warned about spikes and said the virus is nowhere near being contained. “We don’t have it completely under control,” he told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., criticized the contrast between health experts warning about the dangers of opening states too early mere hours after Trump said the country prevailed against the virus. “This is infuriating to many of us because it comes hours after the president declared that we have prevailed over coronavirus , which I’m just going to tell you is going to make it harder on state leaders to keep social distancing restrictions in place,” he said. Trump promoted the country’s testing Monday in a Rose Garden news conference, saying the 9 million tests so far made America a worldwide leader. “We have met the moment, and we have prevailed,” said Trump, who later said he meant the country prevailed on testing. Trump going to PA: Donald Trump to visit Allentown, Pennsylvania factory as he pushes message on reopening Murphy also slammed the lack of detailed federal guidance as states begin to reopen. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said state officials could contact his agency with their questions. He said nationwide recommendations are under review and would be released soon. Murphy said soon wasn't good enough. “You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance that you have given us,” Murphy said. “Then the guidance you have provided is criminally vague.” Fauci: Finding a vaccine 'definitely not a long shot' Fauci expressed optimism Tuesday that a vaccine will be found for the coronavirus within a year or two. His confidence stemmed from the fact that most people can fight off the virus themselves, offering scientists an opportunity to devise a way to get the body to combat it better. “It’s definitely not a long shot,” Fauci said.","Everything seems normal. And yet nothing is. I live in the same house as Carlota, a wonderful, loving and brilliant 9-year-old girl, and the daughter of Chiquinquirá Delgado, my partner. Carlota brought happiness into my life from the moment I met her, just a few months after her birth, and I couldn’t imagine this house without her in it. “Good morning everyone!” she shouts from her bedroom when she wakes up. Her tireless energy — she loves to create dance moves — and curiosity has made the tedium of quarantine a bit easier to endure. Carlota — like the roughly half of the world’s population[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html?action=click =Spotlight =Homepage] living in coronavirus -induced lockdown — has been stuck at home for several weeks now, and there are times when her sadness and frustration rise to the surface. Like when she wonders, with tears in her eyes, if we’ll still be able to throw her a birthday party in May. Or when she wants to get together with her friends and doesn’t quite understand why they can’t come over. One of our biggest achievements as parents during the crisis was taking Carlota on a short bike ride with one of her friends. The kids enjoyed it, but saying goodbye without touching was really hard for them. The truth, however, is that Carlota’s generation — there are an estimated 74 million children under 17[https://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables/pop1.asp] in the United States — is much better prepared than ours to face months of isolation. These young people have been unintentionally training for this moment all their lives. From a very young age, they’ve been communicating with one another using devices that never existed in my time. So when we told them they couldn’t leave the house, all they did was enter “virtual mode.” Faced with adversity due to an uncooperative virus, Carlota has reproduced her old social world in her bedroom, with all her games, music and friends within easy reach; even her classroom is there. She often has three screens going simultaneously: the TV (where she’s watching a movie or a series), her smartphone (where she’s talking with friends on FaceTime) and her iPad. With all her devices, Carlota has created a digital geography that would be impossible for me to navigate. She’s lucky that the internet is working so well in the Miami area where we live. If we were somewhere else, like Brownsville, Texas[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html], for example, the connection might not be so stable. For weeks now, Carlota has been building an imaginary digital house using the simulation game Bloxburg, making videos based on Billie Eilish’s music on TikTok (her account is private; only her friends have access) and drawing amazing works of art with the Procreate app. This cyberswarm is the center of Carlota’s new life. For her and her friends, almost everything is temporary and disposable. “That’s so 2019,” she tells me when I ask her about apps and platforms she no longer uses. The virus, however, is still here. These days, Carlota has new fears. Her once quiet and predictable nights, which always included 20 minutes of reading, have become chaotic and irregular, almost like a teenager’s. Noises she once ignored now awaken her. Each night, she tries to soothe her anxieties with a different plush toy. She knows each toy’s name by heart and where it came from. The ritual of choosing the “plush of the night” is worthy of a reality show, with jubilant winners and vanquished losers. As a family, we’ve established fixed mealtimes, with no electronic devices, and we try not to talk about the coronavirus when Carlota is present. But we don’t change the subject if she brings it up, and we try to answer all her questions as best we can. The virus haunts all of us, keeping us awake at night. It’s everywhere — on the door handles we touch, the packages that show up at our door, the phone conversations we have with friends and family, and in the new rules that keep us locked inside. Carlota is unlikely to return to school to finish the fourth grade. I hear the school year may be extended a couple of weeks into the summer. I hope it will. Regardless, teaching our children effectively during a health crisis like this will require extraordinary endurance and creativity. Everything indicates that, even in the best-case scenario, we won’t have a vaccine until 2021. The children of the 2020 pandemic have a lot to teach us. They adapt quickly to new situations and use technology with astonishing proficiency: Carlota and her friends can Google a solution to nearly any problem. I want to believe that if they were the ones in charge, they wouldn’t have wasted weeks — like our current leaders did — in confronting the coronavirus . In the future, I hope Carlota’s generation puts the interests of science and health above those of politics and prejudice. Whether she knows it or not, Carlota is already a survivor, and she’s better prepared than I am to face the crisis ahead. I envy the strength and resilience of both her lungs and her attitude toward life. I’m pretty sure that Carlota has the numbers of more close friends saved in her phone than I do. But, at least for now, she can’t play with them as I did with mine when I was her age. And I fear that social distancing will become an unhealthy habit for Carlota and her peers. No talking face to face, no hugging or kissing. They’re missing the sweetest things about being human. I can barely make out half of Carlota’s back through the semi-open door of her room, but she sees me before I can walk away. “¡Te quiero mucho!” I tell her in Spanish. “I love you too!” she responds, with a giant smile. And somehow the two of us, with heavy hearts, resist the urge to hug each other.

2,"The history of humanity is the history of impatience. Not only do we want knowledge of the future, we want it when we want it. The Book of Job condemns as prideful this desire for immediate attention. Speaking out of the whirlwind, God makes it clear that he is not a vending machine. He shows his face and reveals his plans when the time is ripe, not when the mood strikes us. We must learn to wait upon the Lord, the Bible tells us. Good luck with that, Job no doubt grumbled. When the gods are silent, human beings take things into their own hands. In religions where the divine was thought to inscribe its messages in the natural world, specialists were taught to take auspices from the disposition of stars in the sky, from decks of cards, dice, a pile of sticks, a candle flame, a bowl of oily water, or the liver of some poor sheep. With these materials, battles could be planned, plagues predicted and bad marriages avoided. In those places where the gods were thought to communicate verbally with humans, oracles and prophets were designated to provide answers on demand. The most highly revered oracles in the ancient Greek world were the high priestesses at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. When it came time to respond to a petitioner who had placed a question before her, the priestess would enter the inner sanctum and seat herself on a tripod erected over a crevice in the ground, out of which inebriating gases were thought to rise. These fumes paralyzed her rational faculties and put her in a trance of receptivity that allowed the god Apollo to speak through her in cryptic remarks and riddles. These would be interpreted by a second figure, the prophet, who answered the grateful petitioner in poetry or prose. It was a very successful start-up and made Delphi a wealthy town. Prophets today are less flamboyant. Former prime ministers do not, as a rule, sniff drugs before appearing on CNN. They sit meekly in the green room sipping mineral water before being called on to announce our fate. Augurs have given up on sheep livers and replaced them with big data and statistical modeling. The wonder is that we still cry out for their help, given that the future is full of surprises. Professional forecasters know this about the future, which is why in the small print of their reports they lay out all the assumptions that went into the forecast and the degree of statistical confidence one might have in particular estimates, given the data and research methods used. But harried journalists and public officials don’t read or comprehend the footnotes, and with the public baying for information, they understandably pass on the most striking estimates just to get through the day. Ancient augurs and prophets were in high-risk professions. When their predictions failed to materialize, many were executed by sovereigns or pulled apart by mobs. We see a bloodless version of this reaction today in the public’s declining confidence[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/] in both the news media and the government. Take a banal example: snowstorms and school closings. A half century ago, when meteorological forecasting was less sophisticated, parents and children would not learn that classes were canceled until the storm began and it was announced on radio and television that very morning. We lived in harmless uncertainty, which for kids was thrilling. When snowflakes fell they even looked like manna from heaven. Today, mayors and school superintendents, putting their faith in the meteorologists, routinely announce closings a day or more in advance. If the storm fails to arrive, though, they are sharply criticized by parents who lost a day of work or had to find day care. And if an unforeseen storm paralyzes the city, leaving streets unsalted and children stranded at school, the reaction is far worse. More than one mayor has lost a re-election bid because of failed prophecies, victim of our collective overconfidence in human foresight. Our addiction to economic forecasting is far more consequential. Here the footnotes really do matter but politicians and the press encourage magical thinking. The candidate declares, My plan will create 205,000 new jobs, raise the Dow 317 points and lower the price of gasoline 15 cents. Two years later, the gloating headline reads: The President’s Unkept Promises. Stagnant growth, a bear market and war in the Middle East make re-election unlikely. Never mind that declining global demand slowed growth, that Wall Street is a drama queen and that a freakish tanker collision set off the war. A failed presidency is declared.","— Caroline Criado Perez, author of “Invisible Women” [In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox[https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/in-her-words].] As the novel coronavirus sweeps the world, sickening hundreds of thousands of people and killing at least 50,000 individuals to date[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html], scientists have learned more and more[https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-coronavirus.html] about it. We know that older adults — aged 60 and above — are at greater risk of dying from it. And, based on data from China, Italy and South Korea, we also know that men seem to have higher fatality rates[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-italy-men-risk.html]. But in the U.S., where ramped-up testing is churning out reams of data by the minute, there’s one thing we’re not monitoring: the sex breakdown. How many women are infected versus men? Are men and women equally likely to get infected? What is the fatality rate for each sex? Are symptoms exactly alike for men and women? The latest update on cases and deaths in the U.S. from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm?s_cid=mm6912e2_w] contained no mention of male and female patients. When asked why, a spokesperson for the C.D.C. said the agency simply does “not have that information to share at this time” and “additional investigation is needed.” Even The Times’s case tracker[https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-county-data-us.html], which was made public last week and provides county-level data, has no sex breakdown because that information isn’t consistently available across states and counties. “We can confidently say from the data from many countries that being male is a risk factor[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-italy-men-risk.html],” said Sabra Klein, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies sex difference in viral infections. “That, in and of itself should be evidence for why every country should be disaggregating their data. But the United States isn’t doing it.” This kind of information — or lack thereof — matters because men and women are likely to have fundamentally different reactions[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/coronavirus-men-women.html] to the virus, vaccines and treatment, health experts say. Indeed, research has shown that the SARS[https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/717919/epidemiology-severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-2003-hong-kong-epidemic-analysis], influenza[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046247/], Ebola[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1510305] and HIV[https://ourworldindata.org/hiv-aids] viruses all affect men and women differently. “Researchers have found sex differences in every tissue and organ system in the human body,” including the immune system, writes Caroline Criado Perez in her award-winning book “Invisible Women.” A recent research paper[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709v1] from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, backs that up: Scientists studied the plasma of 331 confirmed coronavirus patients and found that in the most severe cases, women had a higher level of antibodies than men. Though the paper hasn’t been peer-reviewed, it provides yet another reason to capture sex data. Despite this, the coronavirus vaccine trials underway in the U.S. aren’t really considering sex yet, said Dr. Klein. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease — a part of the National Institutes of Health — is already running phase one trials of a potential vaccine [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/] on 45 healthy adults. The purpose of phase one trials is to “learn about safety and identify side effects,” according to the agency’s website[https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics]. It is also at this stage that researchers determine the correct dosage for a vaccine . But the trials of this vaccine will only explore age and sex “as part of subgroup analysis” because “a larger number of participants would be needed to conduct a meaningful analysis of sex and age differences,” the agency said in a statement. “N.I.A.I.D. is developing plans for potential larger-scale clinical trials,” the statement continued. This approach can be dangerous. Between 1998 and 2000, women represented just 22 percent of initial small-scale safety trials for new drug applications[https://www.fda.gov/files/science%20 & %20research/published/2001-GAO-Report-Drug-Safety--Women-Sufficiently-Represented-in-New-Drug-Testing--but-FDA-Oversight-Needs-Improvement.pdf] submitted to the F.D.A., according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office . The same agency also found that 8 of the 10 F.D.A.-approved drugs[https://www.gao.gov/assets/100/90642.pdf] that were withdrawn from the market between 1997 and 2001 “posed greater health risks for women than men,” including causing valvular heart disease and liver failure. On the other hand, Johnson & Johnson , which is pushing to get clinical trials of a vaccine started by September[https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use], said it would analyze data by sex and age from phase one onward. Sex data blind spots can be traced back to the fact that, historically, science didn’t study the female body. “It’s been assumed that there wasn’t anything fundamentally different between male and female bodies other than size and reproductive function,” writes Perez, so anything that deviates from the “default’ — a white, male archetype — is considered an anomaly. Moreover, researchers often argue that the female body is “too complex” to be studied, with its “fluctuating, ‘atypical’ hormones.” As a result, for years women have been underrepresented in medical research, clinical trials for drugs and vaccines , and biology textbooks. Even in 2015, in one of the tests of the so-called “female Viagra” — a product clearly designed for women — scientists tried out the drug on 23 men and two women[https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/022526REMS.pdf], writes Perez. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health established the Office of Research on Women’s Health[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/11/science/nih-starts-women-s-health-office.html]. And in 1993, U.S. lawmakers required the N.I.H. to include more women and minorities in clinical research and trials. But the N.I.H. has been slow to enforce those rules. A 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office[https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/H92J_d1613restricted%20(1).pdf] found that though more women than men were enrolled in trials overall from 2005 to 2014, it was unclear whether women were sufficiently represented in all research areas, leaving open the possibility that they may still have been underrepresented in some studies. And in 2016, the O.R.W.H. noted[https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sites/orwh/files/docs/NOT-OD-15-102_Guidance.pdf] that preclinical trials on animals still “rely heavily on male animals and/or omit reporting of the sex,” and added that all researchers applying for funding from 2017 onward must provide a “strong justification” for studying just one sex. But these regulations only apply to federally funded research, which in 2015 accounted for 22 percent of total spending on medical and health research, according to a think tank[https://www.researchamerica.org/sites/default/files/2016US_Invest_R%26D_report.pdf] that advocates increased funding for R “These notions that ‘I’ve never done this for any other clinical trial. Why am I going to do this today?’ — these things get ingrained,” said Dr. Klein, and so any shift in procedure and culture “is perceived as an added complication.” Obscuring any sex differences in studies and test results can have vast ramifications. “The moment we started to sex-disaggregate data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we picked up pretty quickly that pregnant women were an at-risk population,” said Dr. Klein, and so “they were some of the first people to be offered the pandemic flu vaccine .” Today, we don’t know very much about the impact of Covid -19 on pregnant women[https://www.nytimes.com/article/pregnancy-coronavirus.html]. “It’s not a lot upfront to get that information, but the systems are often not set up to actually collect the information,” said Dyan Mazurana, a research professor who studies humanitarian crises at Tufts University and an author of a recent report about sex-disaggregated data[https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com-s.fennec.u-pem.fr/doi/pdf/10.1111/disa.12013]. “And then what you need is people who can analyze and interpret that data.” Having this data also comes down to those in charge, said Dr. Klein. The White House’s initial 12-person Coronavirus Task Force was entirely male[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-presidents-coronavirus-task-force/]. Then in February, two women were added to the mix: Dr. Deborah Birx[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-deborah-birx.html], who coordinates the government’s response to the pandemic, and Seema Verma[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/Trump-coronavirus-taskforce.html], the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. At one White House briefing, Dr. Birx noted the gaping gender disparity in deaths in Italy, but that data still isn’t available for the U.S. “Everybody is doing the best they can in these times, but if it is not on somebody’s radar who has the power to get the data out there, you’re just not going to see it,” said Dr. Klein.

3,"Associated Press Florida judge blocks state order for schools to reopen A Florida judge granted a temporary injunction Monday against the state's executive order requiring school districts to reopen schools during the pandemic, the Florida teachers union said. According to the Florida Teachers Association, Circuit Court Judge Charles Dodson granted its request to put a hold on the order issued in July by state Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran compelling schools to reopen. The Florida Education Department said it could not immediately comment. Some districts in south Florida were given permission by the state to start the 2020-21 school year remotely because of high virus spread, but other districts had to begin in-person education, even if they did not want to. In one instance, the administration of Governor Ron DeSantis, a close ally of President Trump, threatened to withhold nearly $200 million from Hillsborough County if it carried out its plan to open remotely. The district changed its plan in light of the threat. Washington Post 7-day virus killer is cleared for American Airlines planes The Trump administration on Monday gave American Airlines emergency approval to deploy a new weapon against COVID -19: a surface coating that kills coronaviruses for as many as seven days. The Environmental Protection Agency issued the emergency declaration for Allied BioScience Inc.'s SurfaceWise2 product, allowing it to be used in some American Airlines planes and airport facilities, as well as two Texas locations of Total Orthopedics Sports & Spine. All three companies are based in Texas, which sought the exemption. This is a major, game-changing announcement for our efforts to combat coronavirus and COVID -19, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said on a conference call. The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to propel emerging treatments and protections against the coronavirus , and as several companies race to deliver an effective, safe vaccine . Bloomberg News WWII ceremony in Hawaii limited to local veterans HONOLULU — A Pearl Harbor ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II — possibly the last opportunity for many elderly U.S. veterans to commemorate the day — will be limited to survivors of the war living in Hawaii because of coronavirus concerns. The plan before Friday had been to allow about 200 people, mostly WWII veterans, their families and government officials, to gather on the battleship USS Missouri, which hosted the Japanese surrender on Sept. 2, 1945 in Tokyo Bay. But an announcement made Friday night said that those planning to fly into the state are no longer invited in an effort to protect the aging veterans — mostly in their 90s — from COVID -19. Tony Vericella, executive director of the 75th WWII Commemoration Committee, said Monday organizers are working on new ways to honor those left out in a virtual setting. Associated Press","But we seem to be living in a nightmare scenario. The coronavirus emerged in the middle of a golden age for media manipulation. And it is stealthy, resilient and confounding to experts. It moves far faster than scientists can study it. What seems to be true today may be wrong tomorrow. Uncertainty abounds[https://www.wsj.com/articles/questions-about-accuracy-of-coronavirus-tests-sow-worry-11585836001?mod=hp_lead_pos3]. And an array of dangerous misinformation, disinformation and flawed amateur analysis fills the void. We’ve grown accustomed to living through an information war fought largely by hardened political operatives and trolls. But while the coronavirus crisis is political and will continue to be politicized, its most consequential fights will take place in the “fog of pandemic”[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/fog-pandemic/608764/] where so much of our data — from health statistics to economic indicators — is flawed or evolving. Today’s propaganda could be tomorrow’s truth. Or vice versa. Even the good guys are working with limited information and hoping for the best. We are not prepared for what’s coming. The best illustration of this challenge is the changing consensus and public messaging on wearing masks. At the end of February, as the coronavirus was spreading in the United States, the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, argued that masks were not effective for the general public, tweeting[https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1233726563881029632], “STOP BUYING MASKS!” Now it seems that information was, depending on your interpretation, overly simplistic, misleading or just wrong. “I’m not sure it’s that the knowledge changed, but that our priorities changed,” Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told me over the phone this week. He suggested that the priority was always to reserve masks for health care workers. “But I don’t think we understood or put in context how masks might affect physical distancing in public,” he said. “You’re trying to juggle a number of considerations in real time, and the wrong balancing act was struck.” On Friday, President Trump announced[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/coronavirus-news-updates.html] that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had changed the recommendation on masks to say that all Americans should use “non-medical, cloth” ones. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s only a recommendation.” But the reversal may prove costly for the World Health Organization ’s and the C.D.C.’s credibility. As Zeynep Tufekci[https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/QiyK8kH1AEyA6YWffSFZFA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRgZwbHP0TfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy8xNy9vcGluaW9uL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWZhY2UtbWFza3MuaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD0zOSZlbWM9ZWRpdF90eV8yMDIwMDQwMSZpbnN0YW5jZV9pZD0xNzI0NCZubD1kYXZpZC1sZW9uaGFyZHQmcmVnaV9pZD05MDcyOTM4NiZzZWdtZW50X2lkPTIzNDk1JnRlPTEmdXNlcl9pZD03YzhmZjNmYzc3NDkyMGE1N2MzOWU1ZDZjYjI4MzI3ZVcDbnl0QgoAIciBhF55sBfjUhpjaGFybGllLndhcnplbEBueXRpbWVzLmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~], a University of North Carolina professor, wrote in a Times Op-Ed weeks ago, a lack of transparency up front created its own information crisis. “What should the authorities have said?” she asked. “The full painful truth.” Renée DiResta, an expert on disinformation at the Stanford Internet Observatory, suggested to me that the mask fiasco was a result of bureaucracies’ responding on the fly to a new threat. “What you have is an institution that’s not designed for real-time communication or the modern information world,” she said. Ordinary citizens aren’t used to operating on the same timeline as the scientific method. We struggle to understand how to interpret epidemiological models[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-models-arent-supposed-be-right/609271/] and we misread them. And we’re unsatisfied with uncertainty, especially when it comes from our experts. Since entities like the C.D.C. are used to making pronouncements when science has reached a consensus, a virus can run around the world before they update their guidance. “In an ideal world they’d say, ‘Here are the spectrum of possibilities informing our guidance,’” Ms. DiResta said. “Instead you see reticence. And whether that’s media or government institutions, you rarely see a formal revisioning.” Masks aren’t the only object of contention. Take the controversy around the anti-malarial drug chloroquine. In late March, the Food and Drug Administration authorized[https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/29/hhs-accepts-donations-of-medicine-to-strategic-national-stockpile-as-possible-treatments-for-covid-19-patients.html] the use of chloroquine and a related drug, hydroxychloroquine, for emergency use for hospitalized patients. But chloroquine is not an approved treatment for the coronavirus , and its side effects include potentially fatal complications. Without solid evidence of chloroquine’s efficacy, it is irresponsible to promote anecdotes about its curing Covid -19, as Silicon Valley elites[https://www.wired.com/story/an-old-malaria-drug-may-fight-covid-19-and-silicon-valleys-into-it/] and even President Trump have done. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil is also a big chloroquine proponent; last month Facebook took down a video of him making unproven claims about the drug. But it’s also still well within the realm of possibility that rigorous clinical trials could show the drug does work, and months from now it could be approved in some form for use with Covid -19 patients. Should that happen, the Trump administration and the drug’s other champions could easily weaponize the current criticisms and social media takedowns as dangerous, partisan censorship. A similar story regarding rumors that ibuprofen[https://www.wired.com/story/the-ibuprofen-debate-reveals-the-danger-of-covid-19-rumors/] (Advil and other brands) might be dangerous as a fever reducer for Covid -19 patients played out last month. The concern, aired in a speculative letter from health researchers, was eventually echoed by the French Ministry of Health , which circulated a warning[https://dgs-urgent.sante.gouv.fr/dgsurgent/inter/detailsMessageBuilder.do?id=30500 =visualiserMessage] against using ibuprofen for Covid -19 fevers. The information ripped through global media, forcing the W.H.O. to issue guidance[https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240409217997189128] that “based on currently available information, W.H.O. does not recommend against” the use of ibuprofen. The fear and uncertainty around the coronavirus is, of course, fertile ground for extremists and hucksters. Alex Jones of Infowars is pushing[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/alex-jones-bogus-coronavirus-cures] a conspiracy theory that the virus is an American-made biological weapon and is directing viewers to purchase any number of overpriced vitamin products from his stores. People who believe the myth that 5G wireless signals are harmful[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html] to health have falsely linked [https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/03/21/did-5-g-cause-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic/2873731001/]the technology to Covid -19. The anti-vaccination movement is also capitalizing on the pandemic. The New York Times used the analytics tool CrowdTangle to survey 48 prominent anti-vax Instagram accounts and found that video views spiked from 200,000 in February to more than two million in March, just as the pandemic took off globally. Another Times analysis of anti-vax accounts showed a surge in followers during the last week of March. In private groups on Facebook[https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-misinformation-fake-news-coronavirus-covid19/], junk science and unproven treatment claims proliferate. But you don’t have to be a science denier to end up seduced by bad information. A pandemic makes us all excellent targets for misinformation. No one has natural immunity to this coronavirus , leaving us all threatened and looking for information to make sense of the world. Unfortunately, the pace of scientific discovery doesn’t match the speed of our information ecosystems. As Wired reported in March[https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-this-pandemic-is-moving-at-dangerous-speeds/], researchers are moving faster than ever to understand the virus — so fast that it may be compromising some of the rigor. “This is an issue that’s bigger than Covid -19, which is that knowledge evolves and things we thought for sure end up being wrong,” Dr. Emanuel said. “This is the way science progresses. Most professionals believe that no single study is definitive. If you’ve done them yourself, you know no study is perfect and they are, at best, a partial picture of the way the world is.” Public health experts like Dr. Emanuel tend to be cautious about predictions and transparent about what they don’t know. In the case of the coronavirus , that can cause a dearth of definitive information — and an opportunity for reckless information that’s partly true but politically skewed. The dynamic is on display during the daily White House news conferences, where President Trump’s claims are often hedged or corrected by public health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci. Misinformation is a spectrum. The most outlandish claims — that the Obama administration engineered and sold the coronavirus to China — don’t require a medical degree to debunk. But much of the pernicious false news about the coronavirus operates on the margins of believability — real facts and charts cobbled together to formulate a dangerous, wrongheaded conclusion or news reports that combine a majority of factually accurate reporting with a touch of unproven conjecture. The phenomenon is common enough that it already has its own name: armchair epidemiology, which Slate described[https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/armchair-epidemiology-coronavirus.html] as “convincing but flawed epidemiological analyses.” The prime example is a self-published Medium blog post titled “Covid -19 — Evidence Over Hysteria” by Aaron Ginn, a Silicon Valley product manager and “growth hacker” who argued against the severity of the virus and condemned the mainstream media for hyping it. Conservative pundits, who’d spent weeks downplaying the seriousness of the virus, were drawn to Mr. Ginn’s conclusion that “shuttering the local economy is a distraction and arbitrary with limited accretive gain outside of greatly annoying millions and bankrupting hundreds of businesses.” The Fox News political analyst Brit Hume tweeted the post, and then so did the anchors Bret Baier and Laura Ingraham. Within hours, the blog post was amplified across conservative media. At first glance, the piece looked quite convincing. Mr. Ginn drew heavily from charts from the C.D.C., Johns Hopkins and the Financial Times . “You don’t need a special degree to understand what the data says and doesn’t say,” he claimed. Epidemiologists disagreed, pointing to some of Mr. Ginn’s assumptions as “unsubstantiated” and ignorant of “first-chapter-of-the-epidemiology-textbook stuff.” After a 31-tweet thread[https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1241522140559503360] from the infectious-disease expert Carl Bergstrom debunking Mr. Ginn’s data as cherry-picked, Medium took the post down, prompting a backlash in conservative spheres. More than two million people had already viewed it. “In a crisis event, one thing people do is engage in sense-making — seeking out facts and coming up with explanations,” Kate Starbird, an associate professor at the University of Washington, told me this week. “It’s a way of psychologically coping with the uncertainty and anxiety of the event, and of having agency in the response.” Mr. Ginn’s post, which seems informed by his reflexive skepticism of the mainstream media, filled two needs for readers: It offered a scientific-seeming explanation that real scientists would not provide. And it provided a political foil, the media. “The online dynamics allow others to seize upon that sense-making process and to use it to further their own political objectives,” Dr. Starbird said. In this case, it drew political lines around a public health issue. Without a deeper knowledge of epidemiology or evolutionary biology, it would have been easy to be seduced by Mr. Ginn’s piece. This, according to Dr. Bergstrom, is what makes armchair epidemiology so harmful. Posts like Mr. Ginn’s “deplete the critical resource you need to manage the pandemic, which is trust,” he told me. “When people are getting conflicting messages, it makes it very hard for state and local authorities to generate the political will to take strong actions downstream.” It’s this type of misinformation on the margins that’s most insidious. “I am seeing this playbook more and more,” Dr. Bergstrom said. “Secondhand data showing a crisis narrative that feels just a bit too well crafted. Mixing the truth with the plausible and the plausible with that which seems plausibly true in a week.” Dr. Bergstrom argues that the advances in available data make it easier than ever for junk-science peddlers to appear legitimate. “Statistical analysis is a black box to most of us,” Dr. Bergstrom said. “And it’s like, ‘I can’t challenge a multilinear statistical regression because I don’t know what that is,’” he said. “And so a form of authority gets imposed on a reader and we tend not to challenge data the way we’ve learned to challenge words.” This kind of misinformation also worries Robert Evans, a journalist who covers online extremism and misinformation for the investigative website Bellingcat . Mr. Evans has spent time analyzing[https://www.bellingcat.com/author/robertevans/] information amplified by the right about China’s covering up the virus. Mr. Evans argues it’s quite difficult to know who is behind the claims. “A lot of the information isn’t wrong” he told me. “It seems clear that the Chinese government was irresponsible in early stages. There’s a good chance they’ve underreported the infected and dead.” While that much appears true — on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-extent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says] that American intelligence officials believe that China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, and Chinese diplomats are spreading false conspiracy theories[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/chinese-diplomats-are-pushing-conspiracy-theories-that-the] online suggesting the virus didn’t originate in China — Mr. Evans says believable information is interspersed with unverifiable claims. One popular theory, in a video posted by an exiled Chinese billionaire and political activist, Guo Wengui (and debunked[https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/26/facebook-posts/chinese-billionaire-floats-conspiracy-about-corona/] by PolitiFact), suggests that the Chinese government is incinerating thousands of bodies to hide the true death toll. “Some of the accounts feel like legitimate open-source investigation,” Mr. Evans said. “There are maps, pictures and people doing calculations about the sulfur content in the air as an indication of cremation. And it isn’t until you get five or six tweets down that it starts to look a bit like a conspiracy cork board.” Mr. Evans is concerned that ultimately important nuance will be lost and pro-Trump pundits will use the news to exclusively scapegoat China and divert blame away from domestic failings. “What’s scary is how smart the false stuff is,” he said. This hybrid of true and false information is a challenge for social media platforms. Covid -19 and the immediate threat to public health means that networks like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube have been unusually decisive about taking down misinformation. “In a case of a pandemic like this, when we are seeing posts that are urging people not to get treatment,” Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said recently[https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-misinformation-fake-news-coronavirus-covid19/], “that’s a completely different class of content versus the back-and-forth of what candidates may say about each other.” Facebook took down a video of Mr. Bolsonaro when it became clear he was using the platform to spread unproven claims that chloroquine was an effective cure for the coronavirus . Similarly, Twitter temporarily locked[https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-twitter-deletes-giuliani-tweet-for-spreading-misinformation-2020-3] the account of Rudolph Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City and Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, for violating Twitter ’s rules on Covid -19 misinformation with regard to hydroxychloroquine treatments. Depending on how you feel about technology companies, this is either heartening progress or proof that the companies could have been doing far more to tamp down misinformation over the past five years. The platforms are slightly more prepared than they once were to counter public-health myths, having changed their policies around medical misinformation[https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/misinformation-coronavirus-social-media-moderation.html] after measles outbreaks in 2019. “With measles there was a lot of available authoritative information about measles,” Ms. DiResta told me. “The difference with coronavirus is that until months ago, nobody had seen this virus before.” But as the pandemic spreads during an election year, public health decisions will inevitably become more politicized. Conservative media outlets may have stopped calling the pandemic a Democratic hoax, but many are still demanding we reopen the economy, in defiance of health experts’ recommendations of extended social distancing. Such tactics are most likely only the beginning. The Trump administration and right-wing media watchdogs will weaponize changing facts about the virus, pointing to them as proof of a deep state bent on damaging the president or a media apparatus trying to swing an election. Others will try to pin the blame for the pandemic solely on the Trump administration (which deserves intense criticism for its disastrous, slow response, but obviously didn’t create the virus). As for the American press, it was slow to accept the reality of the pandemic and is often overly defensive and allergic to introspection. We’ll continue to learn more about the virus, but as the death count rises, so will political and social tensions, all of which will be seized upon by trolls, opportunists and even foreign actors trying to sow division. What we don’t know about Covid -19 will degenerate into ever more intricate conspiracies — some almost believable, some outrageous but all dangerous. “We’re in a stream of ever-evolving data, and it’s being shaped around cognitive biases, partisanship and preferences embedded in our cultural identities,” Peter Pomerantsev, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics and the author of “This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality,” told me. I called Mr. Pomerantsev because the information vacuum around the virus made me think of the title of his earlier book on Russia — “Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible.” In the absence of new, vetted information, reckless speculation takes its place, muddling our conception of the truth. A pandemic seems like a unique opportunity to set aside our differences and focus on the facts. After all, we’re in this crisis together. And we need to trust experts — epidemiologists, doctors and scientists — because they’re all we’ve got. But in crisis situations — especially early on — our desire for information exceeds our ability to accurately deliver it. Add to this the complexities of epidemiology: exponential growth; statistical modeling; and the slow, methodical nature of responsible science. Together, they create the ideal conditions for distrust, bad-faith interpretations and political manipulation, the contours of which we’re only beginning to see. “The really big question that haunts me is, ‘When do we return to reality?’” Mr. Pomerantsev mused over the phone from his own quarantine. “Or is it that in this partisan age absolutely everything is chopped, cut and edited to fit a different view? I’m waiting for society to finally hit up against a shared reality, like diving into the bottom of swimming pool. Instead we just go deeper.” This piece has been updated to reflect news developments.
