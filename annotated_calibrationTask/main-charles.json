This is the absolute worst time. But in an acknowledgment that sidewalks in some areas are already too crowded, the Brookline board backed a proposal to use traffic cones to create walking lanes on some streets where there already is heavy pedestrian traffic, in some cases at the expense of on-street parking. Areas that will soon get more space include Coolidge Corner, where mask-clad grocery shoppers stand in line to enter Trader Joe's and restaurants are handling takeout orders, and Longwood Avenue, a major commuting route for medical professionals who walk or bike. The measure was meant to thread a needle: not encouraging more outdoor activity while making more space for pedestrians in already busy areas. Even that proved somewhat contentious, narrowly passing the select board 3-2, and with the condition that the added space should only be expected to serve essential purposes like buying groceries. Brookline's transportation board gave final approval to the measure, which is expected to be implemented soon. In Boston, Mayor Martin J. Walsh has not taken up any proposals to change streets. But Chris Osgood, the city's chief of streets, said it is “open to exploring closing some roads around parks that are growing crowded. He emphasized a similar point as Brookline officials: “In this work, our focus is not to create a new destination, but to ensure that public health guidance is being well followed by creating more space. The state's Department of Conservation and Recreation took that kind of step Friday, announcing it would close parts of three parkways to auto traffic to make more room for pedestrians and cyclists over the weekend and aid in the reduction of large concentrations of people on adjacent sidewalks and paths. That will cumulatively open up about 1.5 miles on the three parkways, which are: William J. Day Boulevard in South Boston, Francis Parkman Drive in Jamaica Plain, and Greenough Boulevard in Watertown. DCR has taken other action to increase social distancing at its parks, like instituting one-way travel on paths at Walden Pond.", "annotations": [{"label": 35, "start_offset": 3, "end_offset": 28, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:00.589560Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:00.589592Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 167, "end_offset": 238, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:23.544437Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:23.544465Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 239, "end_offset": 259, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:30.654398Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:30.654425Z"}, {"label": 36, "start_offset": 260, "end_offset": 265, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:35.052789Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:29:35.052816Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 416, "end_offset": 435, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:33:30.712825Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:33:30.712856Z"}, {"label": 36, "start_offset": 103, "end_offset": 110, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:34:40.741020Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:34:40.741048Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 101, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:34:53.499025Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:34:53.499051Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 111, "end_offset": 166, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:06.672351Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:06.672381Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 1219, "end_offset": 1251, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:31.860303Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:31.860330Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 1417, "end_offset": 1458, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:42.436980Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:42.437007Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 1465, "end_offset": 1547, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:56.530536Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:56.530561Z"}, {"label": 36, "start_offset": 1551, "end_offset": 1562, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:10.523679Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:10.523707Z"}, {"label": 36, "start_offset": 1460, "end_offset": 1464, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:35:47.760882Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:12.750939Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 1578, "end_offset": 1600, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:21.243671Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:21.243703Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 1601, "end_offset": 1751, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:42.150397Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:42.150430Z"}, {"label": 35, "start_offset": 1751, "end_offset": 1805, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:52.682112Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:52.682155Z"}, {"label": 36, "start_offset": 1806, "end_offset": 1836, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:59.530053Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:36:59.530080Z"}, {"label": 37, "start_offset": 1837, "end_offset": 2058, "user": 9, "created_at": "2021-04-28T12:37:05.352661Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-28T12:37:05.352689Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": "charles"}
{"id": 2799, "text": "Although the number of New Yorkers per 100,000 who died monthly was higher at the time – 287, significantly more than the average of 202 from March 11 to May 11 of this year – the deviation from the norm in 2020 is considerably higher. About 100 New Yorkers per 100,000 died of all causes every month in the four years before the Spanish flu, a figure that nearly tripled in October and November of 1918, the peak of the pandemic in the city. This time around – with more advanced medical care and public health systems bringing fatalities down to 50 a month per 100,000 during the same March-to-May dates the previous three years – the number of deaths quadrupled. Does new school year mean measles or flu outbreaks? Doctors worry as kids miss scheduled vaccinations That puts in stark terms the impact of a disease some still downplay in part because approximately 40% of those infected might not develop symptoms. “They’re comparable events in terms of magnitude,’’ said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study. “I think maybe we imagine pandemics and plagues and other calamities to be this sort of historical events where the streets are lined with dead bodies and there’s pestilence and filth, but what our numbers show is that what happened in New York was pretty similar to what happened in the greatest modern pandemic.’’ Another expert not involved in the study reached a similar conclusion, noting that the new report puts in perspective the enormous toll extracted by a virus that has infected nearly 5.2 million Americans and killed more than 165,000 – in just seven months. An estimated 675,000 Americans died in the Spanish flu pandemic. “The gross numbers per population were higher for flu, but when you account for the changes in death rates due to healthier cities in 2020, COVID has resulted in far more excess deaths than the flu pandemic,’’ said Dr. Eric Cioe-Peña, director of global health for Northwell Health in Long Island, New York. “A reminder of just how bad this pandemic is and how swiftly this virus can kill.’’ Beware: Scammers tell people they're fired or may have COVID -19 Faust acknowledges his report represents a case study that’s not necessarily applicable to other cities or the rest of the nation. That remains to be seen as the coronavirus continues to spread and disrupt life across the country. He pointed out nobody knows whether we’ve seen the worst or just a preamble of the damage that can be inflicted by the virus. Many public health experts fear that the arrival of the flu season in the fall and winter combined with the continued prevalence of the coronavirus could lead to catastrophic results. Faust also warned against equating the COVID -19 epidemic with a bad flu season, as those who seek to minimize the danger the new virus presents have often done. Opinion: We are worried that hospital COVID -19 data no longer goes to the apolitical CDC: Doctors In a JAMA article published May 14, Faust and Dr. Carlos del Rio – also his co-author on the new study – noted that conditions at hospitals treating coronavirus patients have often been much more dire than during a flu season.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2800, "text": "MLB understands that the only way to guarantee complete safety for its employees is not to play at all in 2020. League officials acknowledge that until a vaccine arrives, virtually any idea they come up with will likely still mean that somebody within their ranks is infected at some point—and could expose others—at a time when there is still no proven effective treatment for Covid -19. But in trying to restart an $11 billion industry with as much cultural significance as baseball, the goal isn't to eliminate all risk—and MLB is confident that its plan strikes the right balance. The plan's safety measures are not as rigorous as some previous ideas that the league had kicked around. One of those involved a strict 'Biodome'-style quarantine that would have isolated employees from the broader world. The players considered that concept a nonstarter, not wanting to live under those conditions for months, potentially away from their families, the people familiar with the matter said. The current plan calls for playing games in as many MLB home stadiums as possible, considering permissions from state and local governments. Instead, MLB is relying on players, coaches and umpires to use caution and limit their contact with others outside their workplace. Within the workplace, everyone would also maintain some level of social distancing to reduce the opportunities for transmission of the virus. Under baseball's suggested strategy, the apparent goal is to be able to quickly spot and interrupt any contagion, thereby mitigating how many people get sick, not to prevent any single one of them from getting the virus while at work. Baseball's proposals reflect a realization that other industries have been confronting: The measures required to eliminate all possibility of an employee testing positive for the virus are proving impossible to implement. The league outlined its health and safety plan to the MLB Players Association in a videoconference Tuesday, the first session of what is expected to be a fierce negotiation around baseball's attempted return. MLB will provide the union with a nearly 100-page document that details the proposal by the end of the week, including protocols for testing, workplace conditions, travel and more. All of the guidelines are subject to the union's input and approval as part of a larger agreement that would also settle the economic considerations of playing without fans in attendance. Exactly how often everyone would be tested for coronavirus hasn't been determined, but the people familiar with the matter said it would be more often than weekly, but less often than daily.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2801, "text": "The crisis forced workers and businesses to change up their routines and come up with new ways of doing things. It altered consumer behavior and upended the housing market. The work-from-home arrangements many companies and workers have cobbled together could have lasting effects. Having shown it can be done, more people might opt to work from home once or twice a week or even permanently. As a result, there would be less demand for downtown office space and fewer sales at local eateries, making commercial real estate in cities less desirable. Business travel could also fail to recover fully with the adoption of remote-meeting technologies obviating the need for many trips. Airlines, hotels and convention centers could find that some of the business they lost during the pandemic has been lost for good. Housing choices might be affected too. While many of the city dwellers who pulled up stakes and went to the suburbs as a result of the crisis may have merely been making moves they were destined to make eventually anyway, the premium placed on extra living space has gone way up. That used to come at the cost of a tougher commute, but moving one farther highway exit or train stop from the office is more palatable if you work from home frequently. A vacation cottage becomes more desirable, too, if you are able to work from it during part of the year. Some of our other old habits and routines may change as well. Having learned how to cook, might people end up making dinner for themselves a bit more often? That is good news for supermarkets and packaged food companies and bad for restaurants. And that food is more likely to be bought from the comfort of our homes and delivered as online grocers hang on to many of their new customers.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Previous legislation allocated $25 billion for testing. Some $13 billion hasn't been used. A full $10 billion was set aside for states, localities and tribes; they've so far spent less than $100 million. Much of the new money for vaccines would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , still sitting on $5 billion of virus cash.

{"id": 2797, "text": "Lower rates should help calm markets and make it easier for companies to repay loans, but there is skepticism that Fed action will do much to encourage people to spend as the coronavirus spreads. Money for U.S. health care: Congress and the White House are working on an emergency funding package of $7.5 billion. Some health-care experts have called for double that amount. Much of the funding would go toward vaccine development, medical equipment and protective gear, and state and local governments on the front lines of the epidemic. It is unclear how much money will cover testing. Reports are already emerging of Americans being charged thousands of dollars to undergo testing for the virus, an expense many say they cannot afford. The United States also has 27.5 million people without health insurance, another complication as the nation tries to expand testing and contain the spread of the coronavirus . We need to target and ramp up efforts to protect communities, including the individuals uncovered by insurance, Brusuelas said. Tax credits and bridge loans to keep companies solvent: An emerging risk to the global economy is the bulge of corporate debt that has built up in the past decade of cheap borrowing costs. Companies, especially airlines, hotels and other travel-related businesses, are likely to see severe hits to their cash flow in the coming weeks, making it difficult to pay debts on time. Italy unveiled tax credits Sunday for any company that has seen a revenue decline of 25 percent or greater. Other nations are likely to follow as the epidemic spreads and cancellations mount. This is a weakness that could morph into a recession very easily, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. The real concern is we don't want these business disruptions to morph into a vicious cycle of profit losses, layoffs and insolvency.

{"id": 2798, "text": "College football is even more sprawling than the N.F.L., with athletes who are unpaid beyond the cost of attendance and who lack the bargaining power of a players' union to negotiate how the season and health protocols operate. The sport's largely decentralized governance has left each conference to craft its own plans during the pandemic. College sports administrators for months anticipated ''bumpy spots,'' as Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 commissioner, put it in August, and they note that most games have happened as scheduled. So there is little sense -- at least for the moment -- that the season is nearing collapse, particularly as the Big Ten plans to start next week and the Pac-12 plans to begin games by early November. ''Until we have a vaccine , there's going to be a sense of fluidity,'' said Heather Lyke, the athletic director at Pittsburgh, which is in the Atlantic Coast Conference. But she also said she was ''more confident than I was at the very beginning of the season'' that the A.C.C. title game would be played in December. Still, the week's succession of crises inside the SEC, home to 10 of the last 15 national champions, amounted to ''the first time in a while that college football at least paused to think about something in relation to Covid ,'' said Paul Finebaum, an ESPN commentator who has covered the league for decades. ''It's an illustration of the uncertainty of what we're dealing with,'' said Mike Holder, the athletic director at Oklahoma State, a Big 12 university that had its game this weekend postponed because of a virus outbreak at Baylor. ''No one has the answers. There are no right answers. It's just survive today and hope to be around tomorrow and do everything we can do to keep student-athletes safe, staff safe.''

Instead, the administration is indicating that it will let McConnell take the lead in any new negotiations with Pelosi, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it. But with McConnell and Pelosi so far apart at the outset, it's unclear where compromise might lie — and highly uncertain what Trump might be willing to sign on his way out of office.

Even if we do, it will be a while before there's an adequate population of people vaccinated to really prevent community transmission. Covid -19 has disproportionately affected communities of color in terms of both cases and deaths. Fatalities related to the coronavirus have also skewed younger among many minorities. Black Americans have died at disproportionately higher rates, and some Latino communities have also seen high case rates. The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated long-term racial disparities and inequities in housing, food security and health care, said Nadia Abuelezam, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Boston College. When you start layering those things into an already underfunded and underprepared public-health system, it actually makes sense, unfortunately, that we are where we are today, especially in terms of the amount that we have let down our communities of color, Dr. Abuelezam said.

If ever there were a disease that has disproportionately in a negative way impacted African Americans, it’s COVID , he said.

While the Treasury secretary said job losses would get “worse before they get better,” he suggested that conditions would “improve in the third and fourth quarters” as states began reopening and business activity resumed. Mr. Powell sounded a more cautious tone, saying that a full recovery would not take hold until the health crisis was resolved and people felt safe resuming normal activity. He suggested that Congress, the White House and the Fed itself might need to provide more help to carry states, households and businesses through the pandemic. “This is the biggest shock we’ve seen in living memory,” Mr. Powell said, “and the question looms in the air of, is it enough?” Mr. Powell warned that leaving states to fend for themselves could slow the recovery if local governments, many of which have balanced budget requirements, are forced to lay off workers amid budget crunches. “We have the evidence of the global financial crisis and the years afterward, where state and local government layoffs and lack of hiring did weigh on economic growth,” Mr. Powell said. The differing views underscore the competing arguments gripping Washington as Congress and the White House begin debating the outlines of another major economic relief bill and whether to inject trillions of additional taxpayer dollars into the economy. With an election six months away, President Trump and many Republican lawmakers have begun trying to shift the economic discussion away from more financial support to boosting the economy by reopening states and by additional tax cuts. The Trump administration has said it would veto a $3 trillion bill — which includes aid for hard-hit states — that Democrats proposed last week, and has made clear that any additional legislation must include liability protection to insulate businesses against lawsuits from workers or customers who get sick. In a sharp exchange during the hearing on Tuesday, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, accused Mr. Mnuchin of prioritizing the stock market over public health. “How many workers should give their lives to increase our G.D.P. by a half-percent?” Mr. Brown asked. “You’re pushing people back into the workplace.” The Treasury secretary fired back, calling the characterization “unfair.” Congress has already approved trillions in financial support to help businesses and workers, including $500 billion for the Treasury Department, which is using most of those funds to backstop Fed programs aimed at keeping credit flowing through the economy.

They said that waiting to begin that coordination until Mr. Biden becomes president on Jan. 20 will be costly.

His advisers offered more specifics on Tuesday, saying that the incoming team needs access to information about medical supply chains, data on testing, specifics about therapeutic efforts and other data that will be critical once the Biden administration is in charge of carrying out the Covid response. “There is valuable information inside the administration that is held by career officials,” said Dr. Vivek Murthy, a chairman of Mr. Biden’s advisory board and a former surgeon general. “We need to talk to those individuals. We need to work together with them.” But the advisers also said that the positive news about promising vaccines should encourage Americans that closed businesses and mask-wearing will not last forever, though Dr. Kessler said that people should continue to strictly adhere to the health guidelines for several more months. “For the first time, we can see an end to this epidemic,” he said.

Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. topped 1.15 million, with more than 67,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Sunday. The country has reported more than 20,000 new infections and over 1,000 deaths each day since the end of March, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data. The U.S. accounts for about a third of global reported infections, which on Sunday exceeded 3.48 million. Deaths world-wide have now passed 246,000, according to Johns Hopkins data. Experts warn that these figures may understate the extent of cases and deaths during this pandemic. Epidemiologists say it is too soon to tell whether the lifting of lockdowns will cause infection rates to rise. Scott Gottlieb, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration , told CBS 's Face the Nation that the number of coronavirus cases continues to climb in 20 states, including some like Texas and Tennessee where restrictions are beginning to ease. We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point, and we're just not seeing that, Dr. Gottlieb said. He warned of a persistent spread of the virus and the possibility of new outbreaks. That's the concern: that if we don't snuff this out more, and you have this slow burn of infection, that it can ignite at any time, Dr. Gottlieb said. Ohio Gov.

Secrets Unsealed A cache of documents related to the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime companion of the financier Jeffrey Epstein, could be unsealed within a few days. Ms. Maxwell's lawyers argued for the documents to remain secret to avoid harm or embarrassment to their client, since they include past testimony by women who accused her and Mr. Epstein of sex crimes, but a New York judge rejected the plea. In related news, two mansions that belonged to Mr. Epstein, who died last year, are now on the market for a combined $110 million.

{"id": 2819, "text": "WHO's ability to act effectively is hampered by two big limitations. First, the organization has little budgetary control. Because the overwhelming percentage of its finances come from voluntary contributions pledged to specific projects, WHO is largely implementing the priorities of its donors — whether those priorities line up with WHO's own interests or the top challenges identified by low- and middle-income countries. WHO finds itself increasingly constrained and unable to reallocate funds when emergencies strike. Second, WHO can't impose its will on any country. It can't force a country to share data, implement better vaccination policies or provide universal health coverage. Its ability to get member-states to follow global health guidelines depends largely on its persuasive power. As a result, the organization often finds itself caught trying to simultaneously navigate the worlds of both public health and geopolitics — and these interests are not always aligned. Last year, for example, WHO initially resisted declaring a PHEIC for the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in part of out of concern that doing so would devastate the local economy. What effect will a freeze on U.S. funding of WHO have? If WHO loses funding from the United States, it could have serious and long-lasting consequences. Right now, of course, a funding freeze could hobble WHO's response to the coronavirus pandemic. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres and others stress that now is the wrong time to deprive WHO of its resources. Going forward, a diminished WHO budget will leave the organization less able to prepare for the next pandemic, as well as undermine WHO programs in poorer countries, like the effort to cut deaths from vaccine -preventable diseases in Africa.

Still, Gates said in a recent TED Talks interview that he expects government websites soon to screen patients for coronavirus exposure and send those who meet criteria to kiosks, where they would swab their own nostrils under supervision. That would relieve the need for scarce personal protective equipment and take the strain off of medical workers. He predicted this eventually could be done at home, and that within six months there might be at-home tests that would provide immediate results. Sheldon Campbell, a Yale University associate professor and director of clinical laboratories for the VA Connecticut Healthcare System, said at-home nasal screening “seems like a somewhat dangerous idea for several reasons. ” For one thing, Campbell said, a patient’s complex medical history is key to understanding test results. The at-home kits rely on remote doctors to interpret the results and advise the patient. Patients who have the virus still can test negative, so any course of action should take into account the patient’s entire condition. “I think there is a big difference between a doctor who knows you and a doctor who is operating from a script,” Campbell said. Campbell added that the delay in receiving the test in the mail and getting back results could be critical if the patient needs quicker attention. And he is concerned that at-home tests could waste scare resources in a healthcare crisis. “Even the swabs are hard to get,” he said. “If a home system is sending swabs to people, every one that doesn’t get sent back has gone to waste. ” While many of the at-home tests rely on nasal swabs, some use a drop of blood on a cartridge scanned by a smartphone to rapidly test for antibodies against the virus.

Given the initial anticipated supply, not all groups that are deemed a priority will be able to be vaccinated at once, Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi, a CDC medical officer, said during the presentation to the vaccine advisers. The limited initial reserve is forcing U.S. health officials and their advisers to make hard choices about who should get vaccinated first.

For Some, Shared Anxiety Is Soothing To the Editor: Recently, I watched an interview on BBC with a person who found himself feeling calmer and more content since the coronavirus pandemic began. He reported that the anxiety and panic attacks he had suffered from before the pandemic had miraculously subsided. That has been the case with the patients with anxiety disorders I've been treating for years. Most people with moderate to severe anxiety were coping better than the ones with mild or no anxiety symptoms before the pandemic. Patients with chronic anxiety have an already established neurobiology of abnormal neurotransmitters and neuropathways, as well as psychological defenses, coping styles and social modifications. It's something they lived with day in and day out. The acute anxiety caused by coronavirus is a novel experience for people who have been fortunate not to experience chronic fear and catastrophic thinking before the pandemic. It seems to me that for patients with chronic anxiety, the collective experience of potentially catastrophic scenarios makes the anxiety feel less isolating and creates a paradoxical calm. It's something along the lines of: This worst-case scenario could happen, but wait, others are freaking out, too, so they relax and feel reassured. As one patient described it: ''I don't have to explain to my boyfriend what anxiety disorder is anymore. You know how you've felt in the past two weeks?

Now they are not here, their absences a symptom of the crisis for the secondary-ticketing industry this year: With so few live events -- and fans mostly barred from the ones that do happen -- there are even fewer tickets to resell. Since the coronavirus pandemic began to grip the United States in March, just ahead of baseball season and the N.C.A.A . 's basketball tournaments, many brokers have seen revenues fall sharply. At the same time, they have faced demands for refunds, which has strained balance sheets and prompted them to turn to layoffs, furloughs and emergency grants and loans. ''Everyone is trying to navigate this runway and stay in business so that when the industry comes back, they'll be in a position to get back to what they did before,'' said Gary Adler, the executive director of the National Association of Ticket Brokers.

If you do get charged interest, it's going to be at that super high rate, said Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com . The rates on store-only cards can be higher, he said, in part because these cards are easier to get and card issuers aren't as selective when it comes to the consumers' credit history. But there's a price to pay for that easy access to credit. What about those special deferred-interest deals? Many times, shoppers take on a big-ticket purchase, such as an engagement ring, with an offer of 0% for the next 12 months. Some offers are deferred-interest programs where no interest is charged upfront but you'll rack up super-sized interest charges if the bill isn't paid in full during the limited time of that special offer. No interest sounds great, but there's a huge catch there if they're going to charge you retroactive interest, Rossman said. Can four easy payments work holiday magic?

But by the time their phase-one trials come to anything, it's too late and the virus has moved on, he said. These companies face a long, expensive and ultimately uncertain road, industry researchers said. Developing a vaccine and ushering it through the regulatory process can take years and the outbreak could fizzle out before they can bring it to market. If the outbreak were to wane, companies would have difficulty running the type of large-scale studies necessary to show a vaccine 's efficacy, a problem that emerged during the Zika virus outbreak of 2015. Several companies started vaccine -development programs in response to the epidemic, but were unable to show the vaccine 's efficacy after the virus faded in 2016. It's a lot easier to start a program like this than to finish it, said Mark Feinberg, president and chief executive of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and former chief public-health and science officer at Merck & Co.s vaccines division. Inovio, of Plymouth Meeting, Pa., is developing a DNA-based vaccine , and Chief Executive J. Joseph Kim said that human testing could begin by summer.

After 14 days of battling the Mephistophelean virus, I finally won. The symptoms left completely a week ago. What did I learn? First, despite all of my knowledge of infectious diseases and how this virus was predicted to behave, I was not prepared for the personal battle and the toll it takes. The horror of going through the symptoms is less about how I felt moment to moment, but rather the fear of the unknown. During those long, Rod Serling-like nights, I wasn't sure whether I would make it to the next morning without having to be hospitalized and, worse, end up on a ventilator. This fear of what might lie ahead must lurk in the nighttime fog of every covid -19 patient. I also was plagued by my knowledge of what was happening biologically. I knew that my symptoms were caused by my immune system's overexuberant response to the virus. The immune system coordinates its response to pathogens through the release of what are called cytokines, chemicals released by immune cells that stimulate other cells of the immune system to counterattack. These cytokines cause the symptoms of infection - the fever, muscle aches, fuzzy thinking and fatigue. The overproduction of these chemicals in response to this virus creates a so-called cytokine storm, sometimes of hurricane proportions.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The government reversed course, closing schools and nonessential businesses. It has since brought daily case numbers under control, with fewer than 500 daily cases in recent days from a peak of 1,400 in late April. In Iran, coronavirus cases have returned to peak levels after Tehran rolled back many lockdown restrictions to revive its sanctions-battered economy. Iran last week recorded more than 3,000 new infections for three consecutive days -- the same level as when the outbreak first peaked in the country in late March. Iranian officials said part of the reason for the growing caseload is more widespread testing.But its health ministry has also rebuked Iranians for not following guidelines.

Beijing can suppress its people in a way the U.S. can't; it can't care for them the way the U.S. can. Every country is different. New York City, with three million fewer residents than Wuhan, did not fold under a case load that, by official statistics, was four times as high as Wuhan's, and a death tally nearly six times as high.

But you can understand why Chinese leaders would opt for brutal suppression of a disease for which they would be unable to offer their people decent care as it peeled through 40 cities larger than Chicago. Unfortunately China's Whac-A-Mole challenge may only accelerate as Covid -19 becomes entrenched in countries with which China does business. A growing share of China's domestic cases reportedly consist of the possibly more virulent G strain reimported from abroad. A vaccine may not be available soon; it may be only partially effective. China may never be able to stop fighting the virus with heavy-handed measures. In America, the question is moot.

Sputnik V uses a genetically altered form of a virus that causes the common cold, known as the adenovirus, to serve as a vehicle for a fragment of genetic material from the new virus. The modified virus is then fed into a so-called bioreactor, where it goes through fermentation, growth and multiplication. The production specifications differ for every bioreactor, depending on size, yield and other characteristics, experts say. Scientists then need to tweak production methods as they go, based on variables such as temperature and air pressure. It's a bit of trial and error in finding the right method and it can't be done in advance, said Anton Gopka, dean of the School of Technology Management and Innovations at St. Petersburg's ITMO University and general partner of health-care investment firm ATEM Capital.

This is the second letter in a month that the congressional trio has sent about the Haverhill factory — named after suit label Southwick, which Brooks Brothers also owns. They wrote a letter on July 10 to the previous CEO, Claudio Del Vecchio, urging the scion of an Italian billionaire to pay severance to laid-off workers. Brooks Brothers offered severance packages to employees, including workers at its other US factories but not to Southwick staff because that was not part of the union contract. Unite Here Local 187, which represents Southwick workers, said the union has the right to negotiate for severance when a factory closes, but Brooks Brothers management refused to budge. The upscale clothing company has since agreed to extend health care coverage through the end of August and pay out accrued vacation and sick time. In their letter, Markey, Warren, and Trahan acknowledge the change, but write that without a severance package “these employees — our constituents — will soon be without a source of income. As the expected new owner of Brooks Brothers , you have a significant opportunity to save these workers' livelihoods.” As I wrote in my last column on Brooks Brothers , I hoped the new owners would show some trace of humanity.

Third, every American must be guaranteed coverage and treatment.
