{"id": 2749, "text": "Trump's approval for his handling of COVID -19 lands at 35% in the new survey … compared to 65% who disapprove, ABC News reports. This marks the fourth straight poll with Trump's COVID response approval hovering in the low-to-mid 30s since early July. The public's view of Trump is deeply entrenched and overwhelmingly negative. A huge majority (68 percent) simply do not trust what Trump says and remain convinced he acted too slowly (67 percent). (Also notable — 61 percent think Biden has more respect for the military; only 37 percent say Trump does.) Trump can tell whatever fables he wants to his unmasked crowds. Right-wing media will uncritically report it. Supposedly respectable conservative pundits will credulously accept his excuses and then change the subject. (Hey, how about Bahrain!) His cultist spokespeople cannot provide a coherent explanation for the pandemic's U.S. death toll. (Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel says we have more fatalities because we test more. Huh?) Thankfully, news interviewers are becoming more insistent that administration figures address the Trump covid -19 lies that surely encouraged many Americans to forgo precautions.

It's so hard, with everything booked up. The tests aren't necessarily helpful for someone who hasn't had an exposure but is simply curious, especially if they have been taking other precautions, public-health experts say. A negative Covid -19 diagnostic test also isn't an all-clear from the disease, the experts caution. Testing too early or issues with collecting the sample can result in false-negative tests, and a negative test in the moment doesn't guarantee a person won't develop Covid -19 in the future or even before the results come back. Even for people who are symptomatic or contacts who have gotten a negative test result, health officials still often recommend that people continue to isolate because of the risk of a false-negative test.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 163, "end_offset": 209, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:19.839272Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:19.839307Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 211, "end_offset": 216, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:23.316832Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:23.316854Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 216, "end_offset": 345, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:29.329385Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:29.329440Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 347, "end_offset": 382, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:38.857020Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:38.857045Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 384, "end_offset": 387, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:41.663778Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:41.663811Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 387, "end_offset": 391, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:44.468087Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:05:44.468113Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 730, "end_offset": 778, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:05.346852Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:05.346907Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 783, "end_offset": 787, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:11.529168Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:11.529221Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 780, "end_offset": 783, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:08.469724Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:13.374138Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 789, "end_offset": 876, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:26.708492Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:26.708517Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 878, "end_offset": 1030, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:32.886654Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:32.886676Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1031, "end_offset": 1053, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:37.024592Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:37.024623Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1054, "end_offset": 1057, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:40.358493Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:40.358518Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1059, "end_offset": 1136, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:48.168684Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:48.168708Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1137, "end_offset": 1149, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:51.730262Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:51.730326Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1150, "end_offset": 1157, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:54.308785Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:06:54.308807Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1475, "end_offset": 1491, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:36.919741Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:36.919769Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1491, "end_offset": 1519, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:41.631878Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:41.631915Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1519, "end_offset": 1591, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:47.587595Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:07:47.587616Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Yet, if coronavirus swells in a second wave later this year, will the nation be ready? The leading answer from epidemiologists, economists and futurists: probably not.

{"id": 2747, "text": "U.S. roundup: Protests against states’ stay-at-home orders keep sprouting, even though most Americans agree with caution. As millions of Americans continued to shelter in their homes to slow the spread of coronavirus , several dozen protesters in Texas converged on the steps of the Capitol building in Austin on Saturday to call for the reopening of the state and the country. The “You Can’t Close America” rally followed a wave of similar protests at statehouses and in city streets this past week. Other people also defied isolation orders by protesting on Saturday in Indianapolis, Carson City, Nev., and Annapolis, Md. The United States has the world’s largest known outbreak, with more than 717,000 confirmed cases and more than 34,000 deaths. With more than 22 million unemployment claims nationwide in the past four weeks, some conservatives have begun voicing displeasure with the moribund economy. The protests they have fanned have been encouraged by President Trump. By merely assembling, the protesters were in violation of the stay-at-home orders replicated across the United States in a bid to save lives. The protests do not appear to represent a broad swath of the country. A Pew Research Center poll released on Thursday showed that two-thirds of Americans expressed more concern that the economy would reopen too quickly and allow the coronavirus to keep spreading, rather than that it would open too slowly, causing undue strain. Even among most Republicans, bringing things back online too fast was the greater source of concern. [Analysis: Oil collapse and covid -19 create toxic geopolitical stew.] In Austin, at least 100 people gathered on the statehouse grounds in hats and shirts with President Trump’s slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Some carried American flags, and few wore masks that are mandated by the city. The urgency of the rally was dampened somewhat on Friday by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, who announced that he would do precisely what protesters are demanding: reopen Texas.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 1904, "end_offset": 1936, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:36:38.507791Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:36:38.507814Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1936, "end_offset": 1955, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:00.508202Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:00.508223Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1955, "end_offset": 2021, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:03.942885Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:03.942913Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2748, "text": "Penny Lukito, head of Indonesia's food and drug authority, told lawmakers in a session last week that her agency would delay granting emergency use of a vaccine developed by Chinese private drugmaker Sinovac Biotech Ltd . until late January, when it hopes interim results from ongoing trials in the country will be available. Indonesian authorities are looking to follow the U.A.E. by approving Chinese vaccines for emergency use. The government said last month it plans to procure more than 100 million doses of Sinovac's vaccine , as well as tens of millions more from two other Chinese vaccine developers that also haven't released late-stage clinical results. According to Sinovac's spokesman, the country has already received 120,000 doses of its vaccine . Sinovac's late-stage trials are also under way in Brazil. Researchers helping run that trial say they now have 74 confirmed Covid -19 cases among participants, enough to do an interim analysis, and that they are likely to release early results in December. A Sinovac spokesman said the timeline for releasing information depends on the Brazilian team and scientific process, not human willingness. The Indonesian regulator Ms. Lukito said her agency wasn't able to get clinical data from Brazil. Sinovac's clinical trial in Indonesia began in August, later than the trial in Brazil, and interim results from the Indonesian trial are expected around January. Chinese vaccine developers have had to go abroad to conduct clinical trials because Covid -19 has been mostly under control within China for months. Their Western rivals are running clinical trials abroad too, although they've recruited tens of thousands of volunteers in the U.S. and U.K., where Covid -19 has hit hard. Chinese researchers have been shut out from such places amid rising tensions between Beijing and the West. Pierre A. Morgon, senior vice president for international business at CanSino Biologics Inc., which is collaborating with the Chinese military on a vaccine , said firms like AstraZeneca and Pfizer have an edge over Chinese vaccine developers in setting up international clinical trials, because they have a greater number of skilled staff for running trials as well as connections with foreign regulators.", "annotations": [{"label": 33, "start_offset": 664, "end_offset": 677, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:59.667261Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:37:59.667297Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 677, "end_offset": 696, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:06.291954Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:06.291981Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 698, "end_offset": 759, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:11.942883Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:11.942938Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1019, "end_offset": 1038, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:17.677063Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:17.677106Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1039, "end_offset": 1044, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:20.399247Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:20.399269Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1044, "end_offset": 1158, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:26.143787Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:26.143817Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1160, "end_offset": 1195, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:34.072930Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:34.072957Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1196, "end_offset": 1201, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:36.359859Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:36.359880Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1201, "end_offset": 1256, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:43.186913Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:38:43.186934Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1848, "end_offset": 2004, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:01.210210Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:01.210233Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2006, "end_offset": 2010, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:09.379653Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:09.379675Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2010, "end_offset": 2253, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:18.250711Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-19T17:39:18.250735Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Previously, only one case had been confirmed. Solis said the outbreak of the virus has fueled bias against the local Asian community.

Higher-ups didn’t believe there was a critical shortage, he said. And they told him if one develops, the Centers for Disease Control could change its guidelines on who should wear the masks so that there would be enough for health care workers. “My response was, I cannot believe you can sit and say that with a straight face,” Bright said. “Lives were endangered and I believe lives were lost.” Because the United States waited too long, he continued, the nation had to import masks from other countries that weren’t necessarily manufactured under the same standards. As a result, Bright testified, some are only 30% effective. Health care workers think they’re being protected, he said, “and they’re not.” Bright wore an American flag pin on his suit jacket. Hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes sat next to his water bottle at his right elbow. The face mask Bright wore into the hearing room and took off before he began speaking lay on the witness table. - Maureen Groppe A swab shortage in the national stockpile Rick Bright, an immunologist who said he was unfairly ousted from the Department of Health and Human Services , said he was “quite alarmed” to learn that the United States would have a shortage of swabs and even more surprised to learn that there weren’t any in the national stockpile. Bright said he needed HHS Secretary Alex Azar to request help from the Defense Department to fly back swabs and other needed supplies from overseas. But when he and a colleague tried to raise the issue at a senior leadership meeting with Robert Kadlec, the assistant Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, Kadlec said he didn’t want to talk about swabs. “We were rebuffed,” Bright said. Instead, Bright said, he reached out to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro who quickly contacted the Defense Departments.

Recently published results from an expanded-access study of the therapy involving 20,000 patients found that the transfusions resulted in few serious side effects and that there wasn't an excessive mortality rate. But investigators can't determine whether plasma improved outcomes because every patient in the study received it. Researchers want to see whether drugs made by purifying antibodies taken from the donated blood could work better than the convalescent plasma. The drugs are known as Covid -19 hyperimmune globulin, or Covid -HIG. The first of two trials sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testing Covid -HIG as a treatment will begin in seriously ill hospitalized patients later this summer. The study by Emergent and Mount Sinai would explore whether such a drug could protect against infection. Under the terms, ImmunoTek Bio Centers LLC, which manages and operates plasma-collection centers, would provide Mount Sinai with the machines to collect plasma from recovered Covid -19 patients at the hospital. ImmunoTek's FDA-approved license would be extended to Mount Sinai to set up plasma collection on site.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 600, "end_offset": 615, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:03.801078Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:03.801107Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 616, "end_offset": 621, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:06.253096Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:06.253119Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 621, "end_offset": 691, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:11.505571Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:11.505601Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 838, "end_offset": 935, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:23.941670Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:23.941692Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 936, "end_offset": 942, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:26.710901Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:26.710935Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 942, "end_offset": 1050, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:31.989415Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:16:31.989448Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2755, "text": "Many scientists believe the pandemic likely will dissipate over the summer only to return late this year in a second wave that could be worse than the first. While that outlook is no certainty – just one of several plotted by public health experts – epidemiologists, economists and futurists say the U.S. is probably not ready for what's to come. What we’re experiencing is a massive global destabilization of all our systems,” said Brian David Johnson, a futurist and director of the Threatcasting Lab at Arizona State University. The destabilization described by Johnson is glaringly evident in three realms: Medicine, the economy and emotional damage. – Dennis Wagner Report: CDC official rebukes White House adviser for critical comment A senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fired back at White House adviser Peter Navarro, CNN reported. after Navarro said the CDC's efforts on coronavirus testing really did set us back. We should remind Mr. Navarro that the CDC is a federal agency part of the administration. The CDC director is an appointed position, and Dr. (Robert) Redfield was appointed by President (Donald) Trump, the unnamed official told CNN. If there is criticism of the CDC, ultimately Mr. Navarro is being critical of the President and the man who President Trump placed to lead the agency, the official told the network. The comment comes after Navarro appeared on NBC News' Meet the Press Sunday and criticized the CDC for keeping testing for the virus in the early days of the outbreak within the bureaucracy and providing a faulty test. The CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down, Navarro, the national Defense Production Act policy coordinator, said on the TV show. 'Pharma Bro' request to leave prison to research virus gets denied A judge ruled that Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical executive convicted of defrauding investors and known for raising the price of an AIDS drug by 5,000 percent, cannot leave prison to work on vaccine development for the new coronavirus . A federal judge called Shkreli's request to leave prison to do lab work in his fiancee’s apartment delusional self-aggrandizing behavior that led him to prison in the first place. “Disappointed but not unexpected,” said Shkreli’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman.

{"id": 2756, "text": "For investors, a seesaw week ended with the S 500 stock index gaining more than 9 percent, with a surge during the president's news conference at the White House. The volatility during the week had reflected concern that governments and central banks might not be able to blunt the economic damage from the pandemic. Still, jitters persisted on Friday. Panicky shoppers continued to empty store shelves in anticipation of hunkering down at home for a while. They have bought more than groceries: Sales of wine, beer and liquor in Seattle, Chicago and Boston soared 300 to 500 percent this week, compared to sales in January. A chain in Houston said its sales this week were double what they were last week. President Trump's declaration of a national emergency came as he said states and territories would have access to up to $50 billion in federal money to combat the pandemic. He also gave the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, the power to waive regulations and allow doctors and hospitals ''flexibility'' in treating patients. That is expected to make it easier to treat people remotely. Mr. Trump said Google was working with the administration on a website that could determine whether someone needs to be tested -- a move aimed at avoiding overwhelming the health system with people who are ill but do not necessarily need to be checked for the coronavirus . The chief executives of Walmart , Target and Walgreens all said they had agreed to make facilities available for testing. Besides declaring the national emergency, the Trump administration moved to speed coronavirus screening, introducing an emergency hotline for private laboratories and announcing partnerships with companies working on faster tests. The unit within the Department of Health and Human Services that does biomedical research will award more than $1 million to two companies to speed the development of the new tests. The agency also announced major changes to the team handling the distribution of existing diagnostic tests.

{"id": 2757, "text": "President Trump received Regeneron's antibody drug cocktail late last week under a compassionate use program. Mr. Gates also expressed optimism about vaccines in development. An effective vaccine could help return life to pretty close to normal by late next year in the developed world, he said. Eliminating or stopping virus transmission completely would take two to three years, he said. Progress on both drugs and vaccines will take longer in the developing world, he said, emphasizing a divide that his foundation and other global players are seeking to close. Some public health experts are concerned that misinformation, along with any rush by governments to approve vaccines before testing is complete, will make people hesitant to receive one. If only a small percentage of populations are vaccinated , the new coronavirus will continue to spread. Mr. Gates said U.S. political and business leaders should speak out and help explain the value and safety of the vaccines to their constituents and employees, to lead by example and ease concerns. For example, he said, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation worked with religious leaders in northern Nigeria to persuade parents to allow their children to be vaccinated against polio. Here in the U.S., we should already be thinking about which voices will help reduce the hesitancy, he said. The CDC that normally speaks out on these things hasn't yet had that much visibility, he added, referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If the data on the safety and efficacy of vaccines are clear, he said, I think enough people will be interested and then you'll build up that confidence as more and more people are taking the vaccine and getting good results.

{"id": 2758, "text": "Straus disagreed. “That may have an academic reality to it, he said. But given how many people are out of work, it's probably, just from a policy standpoint, the wrong time. These decisions are in some ways already out of Straus's hands: the House has passed its version of the bill, which would also raise fees on Uber and Lyft trips and impose new taxes on corporations and rental car companies. But the Senate had hinted it would take a different approach, so it was likely that the two chambers would return to discuss the funding question anyway. Meanwhile, Straus's counterpart in the Senate, Joseph Boncore, was non-committal about even taking up any transportation matters before the current Legislative session ends. Lawmakers' focus, he said, must be on the public health emergency and the economic downturn that it has already wrought. “We're obviously in a much different position than we were a few months ago, he said. “We're just in an evolving and ever-changing situation right now. ... We have to face the reality that we're in the middle of an economic crisis and so any further economic impediment on people is something we have to think long and hard about. Transportation is still a “long-term priority of the Senate and may still get attention this year, Boncore said. But “whether or not revenue is included in that, we'll have to reassess, he added. Even before the virus, Governor Charlie Baker had long said he opposed a gas tax increase, and suggested he may veto such a bill. However, he had championed a multi-state climate initiative that would establish a new auction system for fuel distributors to pay for green transportation projects, lifting consumer gas prices by as much as 17 cents a gallon. In pitching the proposal, Baker has often noted that gas prices fluctuate from week to week under normal circumstances.", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 19, "end_offset": 58, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:00.878319Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:00.878346Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 172, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:10.606379Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:10.606415Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 60, "end_offset": 63, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:13.490026Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:17.364409Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 63, "end_offset": 67, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:21.201583Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:34:21.201611Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 725, "end_offset": 742, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:07.832958Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:07.833001Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 753, "end_offset": 845, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:11.470393Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:11.470430Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 744, "end_offset": 747, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:13.709787Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:13.709811Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 747, "end_offset": 751, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:15.889552Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:18.492748Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 848, "end_offset": 922, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:25.398133Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:25.398183Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 934, "end_offset": 1176, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:42.221020Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:42.221046Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 924, "end_offset": 927, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:50.829248Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:50.829273Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 927, "end_offset": 931, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:53.412585Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:35:53.412608Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1178, "end_offset": 1275, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:05.346130Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:05.346153Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1277, "end_offset": 1285, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:08.277230Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:08.277252Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1285, "end_offset": 1289, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:10.408821Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:10.408843Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1296, "end_offset": 1363, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:39.782594Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:39.782617Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1364, "end_offset": 1367, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:44.018166Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:44.018189Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1367, "end_offset": 1372, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:45.896649Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:45.896670Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1397, "end_offset": 1419, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:52.504646Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:52.504669Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1420, "end_offset": 1433, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:56.111238Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:36:56.111260Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1433, "end_offset": 1463, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:03.348329Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:03.348350Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1469, "end_offset": 1479, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:07.357439Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:07.357460Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1479, "end_offset": 1502, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:12.487865Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:12.487886Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1757, "end_offset": 1763, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:22.567167Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:22.567189Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1763, "end_offset": 1779, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:28.268207Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:28.268230Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1779, "end_offset": 1849, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:34.227487Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:37:34.227517Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2759, "text": "in 300 years. Now, as the country braces for a second wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Johnson is walking something of a tightrope as he tries to restart the economy — people will no longer be encouraged to work from home starting next month — while also ensuring that the country’s health service is not overwhelmed. “I know some will say this plan is too optimistic, that the risks are too great and that we won’t overcome the virus in time,” Mr. Johnson add at a news conference from Downing Street. Britain should “hope for the best,” he added, but “plan for the worst.” The changes he announced on Friday apply only to England, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have broad latitude to set their own guidelines in response to the pandemic. In discussing what will, and what won’t, be possible in the coming weeks and months, Mr. Johnson made clear that until a vaccine was widely available and there are no upticks of new cases, Britons should be prepared to bounce back and forth between eased restrictions and new shutdowns. “The timetable I am about to set out is conditional,” Mr. Johnson said. “It is contingent on every one of us staying alert and acting responsibly.” Any changes in the future, however, are likely to be localized, Mr. Johnson said, as England moves from “blanket, national measures,” to “targeted” action. The local authorities will be granted extended powers to cancel events or close public spaces if they face outbreaks, as was the case with Leicester, 100 miles north of London, where a second lockdown was imposed. On Friday, Mr. Johnson also announced that the government would provide an additional three billion pounds ($3.75 billion) for Britain’s revered National Health Service, which was the subject of widespread adulation even as the government was accused of mishandling the crisis. “We are making sure we are ready for winter, and planning for the worst,” Mr. Johnson said. Maybe more than in any other European country, opposition politicians, experts and organizations in Britain have denounced the authorities’ response to the pandemic as riddled with flaws and false promises. Britain has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world as the pandemic has disproportionately affected minorities, devastated its nursing homes, and exacerbated concerns about the economic prospects of a no-deal Brexit. A plan to track coronavirus infections has largely failed, and Mr. Johnson’s announcements have left many baffled. When Mr. Johnson’s top aide, Dominic Cummings, flouted lockdown measures, the outcry turned against the prime minister, just months after his Conservative Party won parliamentary elections by a landslide. Mr. Johnson struck a careful tone on Friday as he announced that the authorities would soon stop encouraging people to work from home.", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 322, "end_offset": 445, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:39:45.365943Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:39:45.365971Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 448, "end_offset": 460, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:39:50.159602Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:39:50.159624Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 460, "end_offset": 463, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:03.549125Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:03.549147Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 506, "end_offset": 541, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:08.552550Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:08.552596Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 551, "end_offset": 577, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:12.069706Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:12.069728Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 542, "end_offset": 545, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:15.809914Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:17.505779Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 545, "end_offset": 550, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:19.389860Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:19.389882Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 838, "end_offset": 849, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:37.874512Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:37.874538Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 849, "end_offset": 865, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:46.308990Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:46.309011Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 865, "end_offset": 1038, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:57.892818Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:40:57.892869Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1041, "end_offset": 1091, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:00.501768Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:00.501790Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1113, "end_offset": 1185, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:04.981141Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:04.981165Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1094, "end_offset": 1105, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:10.617505Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:10.617556Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1106, "end_offset": 1110, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:14.385607Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:14.385634Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1187, "end_offset": 1250, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:22.175949Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:22.175985Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1252, "end_offset": 1263, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:27.400485Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:27.400506Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1263, "end_offset": 1268, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:33.272643Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:33.272676Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1270, "end_offset": 1342, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:38.575890Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:38.575917Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1559, "end_offset": 1580, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:47.571645Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:47.571695Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1581, "end_offset": 1600, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:56.995359Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:57:56.995383Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1600, "end_offset": 1726, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:14.258097Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:14.258141Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1837, "end_offset": 1907, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:28.226198Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:28.226225Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1910, "end_offset": 1921, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:34.749693Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:34.749718Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1922, "end_offset": 1926, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:38.070737Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T09:58:38.070763Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2760, "text": "We will have to reopen, but not having this information will make reopening much more difficult, says William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. I think there will have to be a staged — not sudden — reintroduction to normal life, which gives us the option to pause if there is a resurgence of the virus. President Trump, who wanted the country to reopen May 1, has since said he would leave the decision to governors. Some states are working on plans now for businesses to resume work, and as they do, many of us will be faced with difficult decisions to make about our personal risks and how we should behave. This is a daunting prospect for anyone coping with the individual pressures wrought by a national economy in turmoil, or the emotional pain of not being able to spend real time — not Zoom or FaceTime — with loved ones who live elsewhere, especially in hard-hit cities. Nevertheless, if you ask public health officials what to do, most of them would agree that early May is too soon to forgo social distancing — and to stick close to home if you can. This is true for everyone, but especially for those at high risk. Yes, it will be very challenging, says Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's center for infectious disease research and policy. But it could save your life. David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, who is advising presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on covid -19, agrees. The virus is not gone, he says. It is lurking in people who are unaware that they carry it. The vast majority of us — an overwhelming percentage of the population — is still susceptible.

{"id": 2761, "text": "First, we now have convincing evidence that polling fails to measure accurately that which it seeks to measure, and pollsters have no idea why. We may never know whether the errors arise because pollsters no longer can reliably reach certain categories of voters, or because traditional methods of weighting raw responses break down during a period of rapid political realignment, or because some respondents lie. Worse, what pollsters try to measure is meaningless if the goal of these haruspices and their elected acolytes is to divine some coherent policy agenda from the entrails. Politics and policy making are the companion arts of making tolerable, concrete trade-offs between competing interests. That is not what poll respondents are called on to do when presented with a laundry list of issues in the abstract and asked to rank which one they consider most important. It is, however, what voters are asked to do when they vote for actually existing candidates in real-world elections. This tension is how you end up with, say, around 70% of Britons telling pollsters they support lockdown measures in the abstract even as observed compliance suggests a greater willingness to make complex cost-benefit trade-offs and elected members of Parliament rebel against the policy. It's also how American polls can suggest that Medicare for All is popular, except that moderate voters recoil from candidates who support it. The result is a political class twisted into pretzels following polling outputs that seem to demand contradictory policy outcomes from respondents who were never asked to balance the competing priorities they expressed. What's a politician to do? This is the heart of the debate engulfing the Democratic Party. Moderate Democrats point out they got creamed two weeks ago because their party's leadership followed the polls in several ridiculous directions—on Medicare for All, on energy and economic policies, on criminal justice and race—and the polls were wrong. The retort from progressives such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is characteristically Marxist—Chico, not Karl: Who do you believe, the opinion polls or your lying eyes? That's the nub of their appeal to the supposedly enduring popularity of progressive policy ideas. Some poll tells them that defund the police or ban fracking didn't cost them the election, even if those ideas never seem to be quite popular enough for large numbers of voters to elect politicians who espouse them.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

For 640 of these struggling medical centers, there is no other hospital in town. – Josh Salman and Jayme Fraser Even if you can find an antibody test, it may not tell you much From coast to coast, epidemiologists are using some of the many antibody tests that have entered the market recently to determine how much COVID -19 has spread. The importance of these tests are not lost on Americans, who are itching to go back to work, see loved ones and find out if they have been infected with the virus. Many have questions about where to find antibody tests, how they work and if they can even be trusted. With little public data about the tests' accuracy, experts question whether the tests will give people false reassurances by indicating they have immunity to the disease.

{"id": 2764, "text": "In fact, the federal government on Monday sent a warning letter to Bakker and other colloidal silver peddlers, ordering them to stop selling it. That followed a March 5 cease-and-desist letter from New York Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of false advertising. The National Institutes of Health has warned its side effects can actually be dangerous for your health — including turning a person's skin a bluish-gray color. A representative for Bakker and the show could not immediately be reached for comment, but as of Wednesday morning it appears the silver products have been removed from the program's online store. Last week, after New York ordered Bakker to stop selling the product, a representative from the The Jim Bakker Show defended the products in a statement to The Washington Post's Julie Zauzmer. We believe in Optivida Silver Solution … because of the research and the advice from medical professionals that we respect, the statement said. What has cemented that belief comes from the countless testimonies of its benefits and what we have seen and experienced ourselves. Bakker and his show are among numerous companies and salespeople around the world promoting faulty, ineffective or even dangerous coronavirus fixes or mitigation products, ranging from skin-searing hand sanitizer to bootleg alcohol. The World Health Organization has had to warn against eating garlic soup, gargling saltwater or drinking a miracle mineral supplement containing chlorine — promoted on Twitter by a QAnon supporter. On Monday, the FDA and FTC called out seven companies, including Bakker's, for peddling fake coronavirus cures or using the disease to promote products. Simply type 'Corona' in the code box to save immediately, one company peddling oils, Guru Nanda, said on its website, the FDA revealed Monday. Other homemade products have had disastrous consequences — in some cases deadly.

{"id": 2766, "text": "Even the name of President Trump's initiative to develop and distribute millions of doses of a COVID -19 vaccine by early 2021 — Operation Warp Speed — has contributed to the public's perception that safety will be compromised in the rush to deliver a vaccine , she said. So what can health care providers do to repair the relationship with Black Americans, soured by centuries of medical abuse and mistreatment? Michael Curry, deputy chief executive and general counsel of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, said it's imperative that “trusted voices” in communities of color lead public information campaigns about the potential vaccine . “We have to make sure that African Americans and others who are disparately impacted by COVID -19 know that folks have been their advocates to make sure there's medical efficacy and safety assured in whatever labs are distributing these vaccines and whatever government-sanctioned vaccines are put forward,” he said. Ojikutu, who has been working closely with researchers to enroll Black and Latino participants in clinical trials for the COVID -19 vaccine through the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research, emphasized the importance of acknowledging the medical community's sordid history, Black Americans' justifiable distrust, and the ongoing problem of structural racism in health care. “We have to think about ways to become more transparent in our behaviors and activities so that patients and communities realize what's happening,” she added, particularly when recruiting Black and brown patients for clinical trials, another longstanding struggle for medical researchers. Last year, Black patients represented just 9 percent of participants in trials for new drugs, according to the Food and Drug Administration , while 72 percent of participants were white. “Be very clear about the research that's occurring, what the pros and cons are, why they should do it or why shouldn't,” Ojikutu said. “And even in our conversations with patients, understanding what we know and what we don't know.” The Rev. Dr. Ray Hammond, pastor of Bethel AME Church in Jamaica Plain, said he has already begun “laying the groundwork” for discussions about the importance of taking the COVID -19 vaccine with his mostly Black congregation. A former emergency medicine doctor, Hammond said he has previously spoken with congregants about the need for diverse participation in clinical trials and has hosted mobile vaccination clinics at his church between services. “What I've discovered is there's both wariness, but there's also confusion about what vaccines can and can't do, and what the process looks like,” he said. “Some of it's deep and long-lasting. Other elements I think are specific to this situation, but I think both of them can be addressed patiently.” In a recent webinar with other physicians about COVID -19 vaccine research, Ojikutu recalled being asked by a community member, “Why should we trust you?” For the panelists, it was a sobering moment. “I think everybody paused and said, 'Hmm, that's a tough question,' ” she said.",

''The administration has chosen to pursue the most favored nation policy -- an irresponsible and unworkable policy that will give foreign governments a say in how America provides access to treatments and cures for seniors and people struggling with devastating diseases,'' said Stephen J. Ubl, who heads PhRMA . Mr. Meadows's gambit illustrates the extent of the last-minute scramble by White House officials to score political victories ahead of November. With the president's response to the coronavirus widely criticized, the White House has grasped for other ways to impress voters. In recent days, Mr. Trump has extended a ban on offshore oil drilling off the coast of Southern states, unveiled a multibillion-dollar aid package for hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, some of whose residents have migrated to must-win Florida, announced another $14 billion in aid to farmers and plunged into Middle East peacemaking. Some officials in the drug industry, though, said they found it mystifying that Mr. Meadows would play what they saw as political hardball with some of the same private-sector companies that Mr. Trump is pressuring to deliver the October surprise he craves the most: a coronavirus vaccine . ''We could conceivably have vaccines being given out by numerous companies, and they're all world-class companies, they're fantastic companies,'' Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday, singling out Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer and Moderna as he contradicted his health care advisers and asserted a vaccine could be widely distributed next month. Even more puzzling is why the White House would not have taken a victory in hand that would have let the president extol his negotiating skills and crow about delivering for seniors. Instead, they unveiled an executive order on a weekend that drew little coverage and is far harder for people to grasp than industry-subsidized cost relief for consumers. ''It's objectively imprudent,'' said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist. ''But when you need to change the trajectory of the race, you have to be willing to take risks.'' ''But when you need to change the trajectory of the race you have to be willing to take risks.'' In public, Mr. Trump and his campaign have targeted the drug industry. They aired a commercial over the summer lashing ''greedy drug companies.'' And the president himself has repeatedly complained about the high cost of prescription drugs.", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 117, "end_offset": 385, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:12.425706Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:12.425734Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 389, "end_offset": 394, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:16.282858Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:16.282922Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 394, "end_offset": 426, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:25.074334Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:25.074356Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1034, "end_offset": 1069, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:40.833433Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:40.833461Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1079, "end_offset": 1084, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:47.934823Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:47.934844Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1084, "end_offset": 1322, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:58.590594Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:27:58.590616Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1327, "end_offset": 1468, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:04.894586Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:04.894608Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1471, "end_offset": 1480, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:08.633100Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:08.633132Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1481, "end_offset": 1486, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:11.772347Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:11.772369Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1562, "end_offset": 1565, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:31.429565Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:31.429615Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1607, "end_offset": 1616, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:50.158600Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:50.158631Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1616, "end_offset": 1664, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:54.847397Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:28:54.847421Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2022, "end_offset": 2048, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:06.226221Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:06.226243Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2052, "end_offset": 2057, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:11.087454Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:11.087476Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2057, "end_offset": 2094, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:18.416178Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:18.416202Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2098, "end_offset": 2190, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:23.894778Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:23.894804Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2196, "end_offset": 2287, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:28.021882Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:29:28.021905Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The MGM layoffs announced Friday affect 779 workers, about 20 percent of the labor force at MGM National Harbor, Maryland's most profitable casino. The employees - including spa workers, janitors, waitstaff, card dealers, actors and housekeepers - won't be returning after six-month furloughs that began with the coronavirus shutdown. The casino reopened June 29, after more than three months of closure, with new safety protocols in place. But Jorge Perez, president and chief operating officer of MGM National Harbor, told workers in a letter that the pandemic has continued to affect operations: Due to the mandated capacity restrictions and business demand, many of our amenities and venues remain closed for the time being. The company is offering the laid-off employees health-care benefits through Sept. 30. MGM also said it has distributed more than $12 million in grants companywide to help laid-off workers since the pandemic began. In Virginia, Northam said the state will team with a foundation established by retail giant Ikea to fund the hiring and support of 20 Legal Aid attorneys to represent residents at risk of eviction for the next two years. New funding for Legal Aid attorneys was among the state spending that was frozen this spring, as the statewide economic crisis deepened. At the same time, restrictions imposed to stem the spread of the virus curtailed hundreds of thousands of jobs, putting more low-income Virginians at risk of losing their housing. Between mid-July and August, more than 10,000 eviction cases were docketed in district courts across the state. Northam said the Virginia Poverty Law Center, a statewide support center for Legal Aid, estimates 230,000 will be filed by the end of the year. The new funding is intended to ensure that people facing eviction have legal representation if they wind up in court. Those represented by Legal Aid lawyers have successful outcomes 72 percent of the time, compared with 34 percent when they represent themselves, Northam said. Ikea U.S. Community Foundation is donating $2 million, an amount equal to what the chain's 550 Virginia-based employees received in unemployment benefits when its two stores in the state temporarily closed early in the crisis.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 674, "end_offset": 747, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:04.548770Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:04.548797Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 749, "end_offset": 754, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:13.716517Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:13.716541Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 779, "end_offset": 956, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:25.576879Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:25.576900Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1172, "end_offset": 1192, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:36.839509Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:36.839560Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1193, "end_offset": 1198, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:40.282185Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:40.282213Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1198, "end_offset": 1391, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:52.613080Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:33:52.613102Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2084, "end_offset": 2227, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:18.228405Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:18.228434Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2229, "end_offset": 2237, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:21.145137Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:21.145159Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2237, "end_offset": 2241, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:23.686525Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T10:34:23.686561Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2771, "text": "Stopping fans from coming into Madison Square Garden is a no-brainer, he said, alluding to the Big East men's college basketball tournament scheduled to begin Wednesday evening and run through Saturday. In interviews in recent weeks, epidemiologists have suggested that the coronavirus outbreak could be on the same general scale as the 1957 influenza pandemic that many older Americans remember well. They do not think it would be as catastrophic as the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed an estimated 675,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide in an era when the population was much smaller. The case fatality rate for covid -19 - higher than 3 percent so far globally, according to the WHO - is an evolving number that depends on multiple factors, including access to robust health care. The actual lethality of the virus is hard to determine because many people have mild or no symptoms and are never formally diagnosed as having the virus. Some covid -19 deaths may also have been missed, possibly mistaken as flu-related. In his Capitol Hill testimony, Fauci said that a plausible covid -19 fatality rate could be 1 percent. That, he said, is 10 times as lethal as seasonal influenza. He was clear: This is more dangerous than the flu. We must be much more serious as a country about what we might expect, Fauci said. Even places that have little or no known community transmission at the moment need to take action to try to limit infections, he said: A couple of cases today are going to be many, many cases tomorrow. Knowing how fast and wide the disease can and will spread requires information that the United States lacks, largely because the CDC struggled to produce and distribute reliable coronavirus test kits. †¨The problem with forecasting is you have to know where you are before you know where you're going, and because of the problems with testing, we're only starting to know where we are, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. That's why there's not that much forecasting available yet. WHO officials noted on Wednesday that several countries, including South Korea and China, have demonstrated that the viral outbreak can be suppressed and controlled through old-school public health measures of aggressive contact tracing, quarantines and isolation of the sick, social distancing and mobilization of the public to sanitize and prevent transmission.", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 68, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:08.923814Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:08.923836Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 70, "end_offset": 73, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:12.516213Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:12.516246Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 73, "end_offset": 77, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:15.573109Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:15.573131Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 203, "end_offset": 249, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:27.342199Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:27.342230Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 249, "end_offset": 269, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:33.318757Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:33.318783Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 269, "end_offset": 400, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:39.618960Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:57:39.618988Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1038, "end_offset": 1074, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:13.775569Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:13.775600Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1075, "end_offset": 1080, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:19.106307Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:19.106332Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1080, "end_offset": 1139, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:26.614871Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:26.614893Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1141, "end_offset": 1145, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:30.315670Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:34.183630Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1147, "end_offset": 1150, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:38.755595Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:38.755616Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1150, "end_offset": 1154, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:45.657679Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:45.657702Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1155, "end_offset": 1199, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:53.975672Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:53.975692Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1201, "end_offset": 1204, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:59.981445Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:58:59.981472Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1204, "end_offset": 1213, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:06.541315Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:06.541343Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1215, "end_offset": 1250, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:16.892152Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:16.892184Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1252, "end_offset": 1320, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:23.296051Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:23.296072Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1322, "end_offset": 1328, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:27.682809Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:27.682831Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1328, "end_offset": 1332, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:30.138195Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:30.138218Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1333, "end_offset": 1458, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:45.825571Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:45.825597Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1469, "end_offset": 1534, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:50.263150Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:50.263171Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1460, "end_offset": 1463, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:52.959606Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:52.959647Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1463, "end_offset": 1467, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:55.701238Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T11:59:55.701267Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1739, "end_offset": 1920, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:06.017552Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:06.017601Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1922, "end_offset": 1927, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:11.294018Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:11.294045Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1927, "end_offset": 2008, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:16.767466Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:16.767491Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2070, "end_offset": 2083, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:29.906827Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:29.906853Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2084, "end_offset": 2107, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:48.861672Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:00:48.861702Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2107, "end_offset": 2433, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:01.250508Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:01.250531Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Lorenzo Berra, MGH's medical director for respiratory care and one of the principal investigators of the planned studies, and his collaborators posit that nitric oxide could help Covid -19 patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress. The University of Minnesota this week began enrolling patients in the first U.S. coronavirus clinical trial to test hydroxychloroquine, evaluating the drug in health-care workers and people who live with infected patients. Chloroquine is among the drugs to be studied in a multicountry trial announced this week by the World Health Organization , and it is already recommended treatment by China and South Korea governments. Since Thursday, at least four drugmakers have said they are donating hydroxychloroquine tablets to institutions or increasing production of the compound. The two drugs received praise Thursday from President Trump as treatments for coronavirus , who said chloroquine was approved by prescription, although it is currently approved for other uses. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said that chloroquine's effectiveness on Covid -19 should be evaluated in a clinical trial. Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, a centuries-old compound for malaria that is found in small amounts in products such as tonic water. As focus on the drug's promise emerge, sellers have jacked up prices on a form of chloroquine that is sold to be used in aquariums to kill organisms, according to an analysis from social-media intelligence firm Storyful. These products won't be effective for coronavirus because prescription drugs are much more potent, said Matthew Might, director of the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 409, "end_offset": 428, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:30.670737Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:30.670768Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 429, "end_offset": 438, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:34.026506Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:34.026528Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 438, "end_offset": 486, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:47.740835Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:01:47.740884Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 172, "end_offset": 407, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:01.621982Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:01.622027Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1098, "end_offset": 1242, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:42.862821Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:42.862842Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1242, "end_offset": 1253, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:49.774276Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:49.774300Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1253, "end_offset": 1340, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:55.259034Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:02:55.259070Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1965, "end_offset": 1980, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:03:51.377145Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:03:51.377198Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2013, "end_offset": 2021, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:01.294748Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:01.294770Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2022, "end_offset": 2112, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:10.535430Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:10.535453Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2114, "end_offset": 2176, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:29.252645Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:29.252676Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2178, "end_offset": 2183, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:32.183974Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:32.184003Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2183, "end_offset": 2268, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:38.541583Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:04:38.541617Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

{"id": 2774, "text": "Republican leaders in Lansing have said they will honor the popular will of voters in Michigan. But they are continuing to solicit complaints about the vote-counting process, and several legislators have called for more scrutiny before the state's vote is certified. Two Republican state senators wrote a letter to Nessel late Thursday requesting that the results first be audited. Stu Sandler, a Michigan lawyer and Republican political consultant, said Friday's court decision would not deter that effort. There are some real credible allegations about flaws in the way the process worked, he said. For their part, election officials in Georgia on Friday began the laborious process of recounting by hand every one of the nearly 5 million ballots cast in the state's presidential election. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has said that the election was fair and transparent and that he expects the recount to confirm the results, which have Biden ahead by more than 14,000 votes. Meanwhile, in Arizona, a judge Friday dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and the state Republican Party after lawyers for the plaintiffs acknowledged in a court filing that the suit would make no difference to the result of the presidential election. The plaintiffs initially claimed that up to thousands of allegedly mishandled ballots in the state's most populous county, Maricopa, would prove determinative in the presidential election, and they sought to delay certification of Arizona's results until there could be a hand recount of affected votes. But the scope of the campaign's legal action was steadily whittleddown this week in court, particularly aftercounty officials said fewer than 200 votes for president were at stake. Biden leads by 11,000 votes in Arizona. In its latest filing Friday, Trump's team acknowledged that its suit would have no bearing on the outcome of the presidential election in the state, writing that the tabulation of votes statewide has rendered unnecessary a judicial ruling as to the presidential electors. The new filing came a day after a Maricopa County Superior Court judge held a day-long hearing in the matter, in which the judge refused to admit some of the evidence gathered by the campaign, indicating that he found it untrustworthy. During the hearing, an attorney for the president's campaign, Kory Langhofer, emphasized that the campaign was not alleging that any fraud took place in the state,a sharp contrastwith the stop the steal protests that outraged Trump supporters have held in Arizona. We're not alleging that anyone was stealing the election, Langhofer said, adding later, The allegation here is that, in what appears to be a limited number of cases, there were good-faith errors in operating machines that should result in further review of certain ballots.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 29, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:43.892088Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:43.892117Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 29, "end_offset": 39, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:48.713610Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:48.713645Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 40, "end_offset": 94, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:53.506660Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:10:53.506697Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 382, "end_offset": 448, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:08.666622Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:08.666673Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 450, "end_offset": 455, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:11.560296Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:11.560335Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 455, "end_offset": 506, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:15.300085Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:15.300108Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 792, "end_offset": 843, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:29.315005Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:29.315028Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 845, "end_offset": 858, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:34.789193Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:34.789257Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 859, "end_offset": 951, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:42.763139Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:11:42.763164Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1298, "end_offset": 1313, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:10.949574Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:10.949597Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1313, "end_offset": 1335, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:19.649421Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:19.649449Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1336, "end_offset": 1600, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:26.296042Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:26.296071Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1823, "end_offset": 1864, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:44.848247Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:44.848274Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1865, "end_offset": 1878, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:48.587109Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:48.587138Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1878, "end_offset": 2093, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:53.707798Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:12:53.707846Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2331, "end_offset": 2407, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:03.773266Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:03.773289Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2409, "end_offset": 2420, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:06.598559Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:06.598585Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2420, "end_offset": 2594, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:11.658044Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:11.658069Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2596, "end_offset": 2652, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:20.262391Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:20.262441Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2654, "end_offset": 2664, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:22.698298Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:22.698320Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2664, "end_offset": 2668, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:26.922644Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:26.922667Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2684, "end_offset": 2868, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:34.081192Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:34.081221Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2670, "end_offset": 2682, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:42.084965Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:13:42.084987Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

They want to control what you see and think and believe, so they can control how you live, said Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality who is on the Trump campaign's payroll. They want to enslave you to the weak, dependent, liberal, victim ideology, to the point that you will not recognize this country or yourself. She described the current president as an emancipator.

Will she ever return to the job she has carried out faithfully for all these decades? Andrew Morton thinks not. The British journalist, best known for revealing the rancorous collapse of the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, claimed recently that the pandemic has done more damage to the monarchy than the 17th-century English Civil War (which resulted in the execution of one of the queen's predecessors). “The brutal truth is that her reign is effectively over. COVID -19 has done more damage to the monarchy than Oliver Cromwell, Morton told The Daily Telegraph. Corona has practically put Charles on the throne...It’s terribly sad but I can’t see how the queen can resume her job. Victoria Arbiter, CNN's royal commentator and the daughter of a former press secretary to the queen, is skeptical. In my view, he's vastly overstating the situation, Arbiter says. The queen is very much still running the business of the monarchy. (Morton) has a crystal ball not available to anybody else, sniffs Sally Bedell Smith, the American acclaimed biographer of multiple royals, including the queen. It's really premature to say she's going to withdraw like (her great-great grandmother) Queen Victoria from all public appearances....Unless she gets ill in one way or another, when it's appropriate she will resume her duties when she can.

Still, the data here, he said, make “clear that Massachusetts is effectively bringing the fight to the virus. The recent surge in other parts of the country has prompted some states to pause, or even reverse, their reopening plans. In Massachusetts, though, new cases remain low relative to their peaks this spring. The state Thursday reported 51 new confirmed or probable deaths from COVID -19, bringing the total to 8,132. The number of people testing positive climbed by 195, to 109,338. The Baker administration has watched those numbers closely, trying to balance containing the virus with kick-starting an economy that has shed more than 1 million jobs since the pandemic first hit in March. The low numbers gave state officials enough confidence, Baker said, to move on to Phase of their four-part plan, which allows many indoor venues to reopen, with a host of safety guidelines, loosens some restrictions on gatherings, and permits pro sports, though without fans. As in other phases, it will be a bit slower in Boston — something Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he supports — to give both city officials and businesses in the state's largest and most complex city more time to refine new procedures and protocols. Some businesses have been readying for this day for some time, even as they acknowledge there's no telling what consumers will do and life won't really be back to normal for a while Cindy Brown, chief executive of Boston Duck Tours, said her company has been training their drivers on new safety protocols, designing new seating plans for 50 percent capacity, and stashing their trademark Duck Lips yellow quackers away for another, post-pandemic, summer. They'll only run half as many tours, at least to start, but they're eager to get going when tour buses can resume in Boston on July 13. “I think there's a pent-up demand from people who want to do anything but stay home, she said. “People are happy being outside, and we're looking forward to welcoming people back. Gyms, too, are trying to figure out the new rules and how they might make ends meet with limits of 40 percent capacity and 14-foot spacing between exercise equipment (though that can be reduced to 6 feet if they install barriers).", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 1, "end_offset": 64, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:41.935411Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:41.935461Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 66, "end_offset": 69, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:45.203559Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:45.203580Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 69, "end_offset": 73, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:47.381347Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:47.381383Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 76, "end_offset": 133, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:52.411644Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:24:52.411664Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 135, "end_offset": 138, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:02.116002Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:02.116031Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 138, "end_offset": 142, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:04.362004Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:04.362027Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 144, "end_offset": 221, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:22.804797Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:22.804840Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 811, "end_offset": 865, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:37.265397Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:37.265418Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 867, "end_offset": 873, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:39.739625Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:39.739651Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 873, "end_offset": 877, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:42.274056Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:42.274087Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 879, "end_offset": 1085, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:53.000594Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:25:53.000624Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1152, "end_offset": 1174, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:08.756023Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:08.756054Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1175, "end_offset": 1180, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:11.471930Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:11.471952Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1180, "end_offset": 1330, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:22.279494Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:22.279519Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1514, "end_offset": 1563, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:39.503315Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:39.503337Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1565, "end_offset": 1570, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:41.884895Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:41.884998Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1570, "end_offset": 1786, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:54.937287Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:26:54.937318Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1925, "end_offset": 2007, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:47.271624Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:47.271649Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2009, "end_offset": 2013, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:50.887868Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:50.887941Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2013, "end_offset": 2017, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:54.908776Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:27:54.908808Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2018, "end_offset": 2102, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:28:11.622586Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:28:11.622609Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2778, "text": "State officials also reported that 27,644 more people had been tested for coronavirus , bringing the total to more than 2.02 million. The number of administered tests climbed to nearly 3.2 million. The state also reported that new antibody tests had been completed for 346 people, bringing that total to 117,453. The seven-day rate of positive tests stayed steady at 0.8 percent, which is the lowest observed figure for that metric. On the flu, Baker said the state currently has an 81 percent vaccination rate among elementary school-aged students but, “we can do better and we should.” The governor added that he knows some people are “troubled” by the requirement, announced last month, that all K-12 children and college students get a flu shot, but “I have to come back to the message that came from a community that really put themselves on the line for the people here in Massachusetts at the end of the winter and through the spring, which was our health care community.” Those workers, Baker said, indicated that “everything we can do to ensure that people are vaccinated for the flu makes their ability to do what they need to do for people here in Massachusetts through the flu season” and a potential second COVID surge more manageable. During a later briefing outside Boston City Hall, Mayor Martin J. Walsh told reporters that the city was reporting 60 new COVID -19 cases for a total of 16,430. For the week ending Sept. 12., Walsh said, the positive test rate in Boston was 2.8 percent, up from 1.5 percent the week before. He said some of the increase is due to fewer tests over Labor Day weekend. Walsh added that 48 percent of all new cases in the past two weeks were from people under the age of 30. I understand young people will be active and social, but we also need you to be cautious and be careful,” Walsh said. At the earlier briefing with Baker in Roslindale, state Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders also briefed reporters and said 81 percent rate of pediatric flu vaccinations put Massachusetts at the top of the list nationally. And, Sudders said, state officials “strongly recommend everyone over the age of 6 months get vaccinated . During the 2019-2020 flu season, Sudders said, 6,600 people in Massachusetts died of influenza, and more than 40,000 cases were reported to the state Department of Public Health. There were also 55,000 emergency room visits for the flu, Sudders said. Public school students learning remotely are not exempt from the requirement.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 1838, "end_offset": 1968, "user": 4, "created_at":

{"id": 2779, "text": "If Harrisburg reopens in May, the virus’s spread could fizzle out as soon as June if the community adds workplace safety measures and maintains more moderate social distancing. This means that areas in the country that are less densely populated or are already benefiting from warmer spring temperatures will probably be able to reopen more quickly, as long as the number of cases in their area have sharply reduced — we can’t give an exact rate — and if they maintain workplace safety, moderate distancing, and test to identify and trace outbreaks early. Large, densely populated cities are going to need a more cautious plan. This is not just because more crowded areas increase the risk of spread, but also because we’re learning that crowding itself may also affect the death rate. A relationship between the amount of virus to which one is initially exposed and the severity of the illness is found in most infectious diseases. Models assessing outcomes from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic reveal that the likelihood of death was dependent upon the number of infected individuals with whom that person came into contact. When a family is infected by chickenpox, the second child to contract the virus often becomes more seriously ill, presumably because they have been exposed to more of the virus. Although we are racing to establish the same associations for this coronavirus , there is every reason to believe they are there. Some clinicians have become severely ill in this epidemic, including the more than 100 doctors who have died in Italy. It is likely that their exposure to large quantities of the virus in close quarters, without adequate protection, was unforgiving. The same reasoning could explain why grocery store, restaurant and mass transit workers, whose exposure risks far exceed other professions, have also been disproportionately impacted. The synergy of easier transmission and higher viral load may partly explain why the death rate for those infected with the coronavirus in New York City has been estimated as high as 0.9 percent based on recent serology studies, much higher than estimates in other areas of the country. Now that we understand that crowding is the problem, we can begin to plot a path forward. That journey would acknowledge that while some people can’t change their living circumstances, and many workers can’t avoid the crowded settings of their jobs, we can accept the importance that distancing can have in breaking the epidemic. For those on a crowded bus in Chicago or in a grocery store in Boston, their protection will be a face mask.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso on Thursday granted requests to temporarily halt the order. The requests were made by the Texas Attorney General's Office and a group of 10 El Paso restaurant companies, who argue that Samaniego's order is illegal because it is counter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Oct. 7 order tied to reopening Texas businesses. The court, in a 2-1 decision, ruled several sections of Samaniego's order cannot be enforced, including shutting down nonessential businesses, until the court makes its final judgment, which is expected Friday. “We exercise our discretion to preserve the status quo as it existed just prior to the issuance of the county’s later, more restrictive Stay-at-Home Order” until the court makes its final judgment, the court ruled. – Vic Kolenc and Eleanor Dearman, El Paso Times More than 2,000 Pennsylvania nurses plan to go on strike next week More than 2,000 nurses represented by a union plan to go on strike next week as a surge in coronavirus cases continues to overwhelm hospitals nationwide. In Bucks County, more than 760 nurses at St. Mary Medical Center will go on strike starting Tuesday unless they reach a contract with the hospital's owner Trinity Health. In Philadelphia, some 500 nurses at St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children and about 1,000 at Einstein Medical Center have also authorized to strike, the New York Times reported. “Nurses are stretched so thin, and I know they’re not able to get where they need to be, Maria Plano, a nurse at St. Christopher’s and the union’s vice president, told CBS Philly. We need some kind of guidelines where nurses are in the discussion and helping to make the decisions. In a statement last week, the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals said nurses are being pushed to the brink by unsafe staffing that seriously undermines patient safety,” the newspaper reported. Costco to require all customers to wear masks starting Monday Costco , which was one of the first retailers to mandate shoppers wear masks amid the coronavirus pandemic, is updating its face mask policy. Starting Monday, the wholesale club says it will require all members, guests and employees to wear a face mask or face shield with the exception of children under 2. Members and guests must wear a face mask that covers their mouth and nose at all times, Costco said on its COVID -19 updates page.", "annotations": [{"label": 34, "start_offset": 820, "end_offset": 1016, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:10.972042Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:10.972064Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1018, "end_offset": 1027, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:17.516548Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:17.516592Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1028, "end_offset": 1033, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:24.358387Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:24.358411Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1625, "end_offset": 1644, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:35.275745Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:35.275776Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1645, "end_offset": 1653, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:39.447456Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:43:39.447478Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1656, "end_offset": 1742, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:01.976816Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:01.976837Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1474, "end_offset": 1624, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:13.948228Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:13.948277Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1744, "end_offset": 1816, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:25.135564Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:25.135585Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1818, "end_offset": 1823, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:30.273866Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:30.273896Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1937, "end_offset": 2032, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:40.787747Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:40.787769Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2032, "end_offset": 2038, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:51.507644Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:44:51.507666Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 2038, "end_offset": 2135, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:14.061423Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:14.061477Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 2151, "end_offset": 2159, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:52.646533Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:52.646560Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 2136, "end_offset": 2151, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:49.867942Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:45:54.218634Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2782, "text": "Nine drugmakers said earlier this month that their chief executives pledged not to file for regulatory approval or authorization of their vaccines until they have been shown to work safely  through late-stage clinical testing. The president told reporters the administration was on track to distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October, he said, once the vaccine is authorized by the FDA . Mr. Biden, however, said after a 90-minute briefing with public health experts that he believed a vaccine was unlikely to be available to most Americans until well into 2021. Mr. Biden's campaign recently laid out guidelines for the authorization of a vaccine , which called on the Trump administration to make public its criteria for ensuring that a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy as well as a plan to distribute it cost-free. He has said he would take a vaccine tomorrow if one were available. Scientific breakthroughs don't care about calendars any more than the virus does. They certainly don't adhere to election cycles, Mr. Biden said. And their timing, their approval, and their distribution should never, ever be distorted by political considerations. Large percentages of Americans are reluctant, skeptical or opposed to taking a vaccine , according to surveys and researchers, citing concerns about safety because of the quick development pace and government overreach. A Gallup poll in August found one in three Americans wouldn't take a Covid -19 vaccine if it were available free of charge. An NBC News poll in August also found that less than half of Americans would get a government-approved coronavirus vaccine if one becomes widely available. Mr. Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, said earlier this month that she wouldn't trust Mr. Trump's word alone on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine . It would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about, Ms. Harris said in an interview with CNN. Polls show Mr. Biden maintaining a national lead over Mr. Trump but that the race is tightening race in some key battleground states.", "annotations": [{"label": 32, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 15, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:27.758246Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:27.758271Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 16, "end_offset": 21, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:29.947113Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:29.947136Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 21, "end_offset": 225, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:36.905663Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:36.905685Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 227, "end_offset": 240, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:45.438282Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:45.438321Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 241, "end_offset": 255, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:51.402594Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:51.402617Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 256, "end_offset": 355, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:57.875045Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:48:57.875073Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 357, "end_offset": 398, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:02.767646Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:02.767672Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 400, "end_offset": 403, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:06.770371Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:06.770394Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 403, "end_offset": 407, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:09.294040Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:09.294062Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 409, "end_offset": 450, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:16.096582Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:16.096604Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 453, "end_offset": 462, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:21.031858Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:21.031897Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 473, "end_offset": 478, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:26.870295Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:26.870330Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 537, "end_offset": 626, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:35.539397Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:35.539419Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 911, "end_offset": 914, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:45.009838Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:49:45.009892Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 914, "end_offset": 922, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:01.321451Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:01.321471Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 923, "end_offset": 977, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:06.640857Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:06.640877Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1061, "end_offset": 1107, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:15.594889Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:15.594915Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1109, "end_offset": 1119, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:22.677827Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:22.677868Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1119, "end_offset": 1123, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:33.804292Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:33.804323Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1462, "end_offset": 1486, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:44.584668Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:44.584700Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1486, "end_offset": 1493, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:50.525522Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:50.525549Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1493, "end_offset": 1585, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:56.370391Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:50:56.370422Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1587, "end_offset": 1613, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:05.960451Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:05.960472Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1614, "end_offset": 1624, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:09.807184Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:09.807206Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1624, "end_offset": 1741, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:13.237340Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:13.237371Z"}, {"label": 32, "start_offset": 1743, "end_offset": 1801, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:19.876903Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:19.876944Z"}, {"label": 33, "start_offset": 1803, "end_offset": 1807, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:25.688637Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:25.688657Z"}, {"label": 34, "start_offset": 1808, "end_offset": 1913, "user": 4, "created_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:37.952388Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-20T12:51:37.952410Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

{"id": 2784, "text": "Parents learned the next day that a student who attended the public school had tested positive for COVID -19, according to a letter sent to parents obtained by USA TODAY. I am not naïve in thinking that we wouldn’t have exposures, but I didn’t think it would be Day 1 and beyond our control, school principal Bill Runey said in a statement. The student didn't return to classes Tuesday and 29 students were told to quarantine for 14 days. “This unacceptable outcome was caused by delays in the reporting timeline, not a breakdown in our safety protocols,” Superintendent David Sawyer wrote in another letter to families. “Our nurses diligently have identified all of the close contacts and notified these families of the need for these students to quarantine for fourteen days.” Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux told local station WHBH-TV it was “egregious” and “reckless” for the parents to send their child knowing they were infected with the coronavirus . Heroux said a public health nurse for the city spoke to the family on Tuesday and confirmed that they had known their child was positive for the virus before sending them to school, NBC News reported. Expert USA TODAY panel: Data, data and more data will make a coronavirus vaccine safe Changing guidelines: CDC reverses controversial coronavirus testing guidance that ignored asymptomatic spread According to WHDH-TV, the Attleboro school district has about 6,000 students in its system and opted to begin the school year with a mix of in-person classes and remote learning. Classes are continuing. “I’m a little frightened for my health,” high school student Iza King told the local station. “I’m worried for my safety.” Although the school does not conduct temperature checks, Runey said the school made it clear to students and parents to conduct a Daily Health Checklist at home to determine if it's safe to go to school. The checklist includes a screening of symptoms that could possibly be an indication of coronavirus infection such as sore throat, fever, loss of taste or smell, or headache.

{"id": 2785, "text": "That $6.5 billion profit is the third highest achieved by any Blackstone fund, behind only dispositions of Hilton Hotels Worldwide Inc. and Equity Office Properties Trust . Blackstone and its investors' resolve to hold on to the company—the first time Blackstone real-estate funds have executed this kind of transaction—is the latest sign of intensifying demand for the fast-growing real estate niche. The business of providing lab space has taken off in recent years as new drugs, treatments and devices are increasingly developed at startup firms, rather than in-house at large pharmaceutical companies. Interest in the life-sciences sector from developers, investors and financial backers already was strong in recent years, and the unfortunate arrival of Covid -19 brought even more attention and capital into the sector, said Steve Purpura, a vice chairman in real-estate firm CBRE Group Inc . 's life-sciences group. The average vacancy rate for the 13 largest life-sciences markets was 6.1% at the end of the second quarter, compared with an office-vacancy rate nearly double that in those markets, CBRE said. With the industry moving some overseas operational facilities back to the U.S., that could generate even more demand, the firm added. Divisions of JPMorgan Chase & Co . and Related Cos. have also been owners of life-science properties, while venture-capital money continues to pour into life-science startups—$17.8 billion for the year ended in the second quarter, a record for a four-quarter period, according to data in a CBRE report. The BioMed transaction also reflects how Blackstone continues to shift its $329 billion global real-estate portfolio away from many traditional bricks-and-mortar investments in favor of properties serving new businesses and industries. We look at what is happening in the world, said Kathleen McCarthy, global co-head of Blackstone 's real estate group, and ask if there is a way to put what we see into a real estate context. For Blackstone , that has meant ramping up purchases of industrial warehouses that service e-commerce and acquiring stakes in production facilitieswhere companies like Netflix Inc . and Walt Disney Co . are creating content.

Aside from those jailed on terrorism charges, prisoners detained for sex offenses, drug offenses and first-degree murder were also excluded. The law has been criticized by opposition parties for excluding those jailed on terrorism charges, which include journalists and politicians swept up in a crackdown following a coup attempt in 2016. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul on Monday said there were 17 cases of the coronavirus in five prisons, and that three inmates had died from the virus.

In response, some prisons have released inmates to contain outbreaks, though critics say officials have been too slow to act. Earlier this month, Attorney General William P. Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons to expand the group of federal inmates eligible for early release and to prioritize those at three facilities where known coronavirus cases have grown precipitously, as the virus threatens to overwhelm prison medical facilities and nearby hospitals.

China has approved clinical trials for two experimental vaccines to treat the coronavirus , the official news agency Xinhua reported on Tuesday, in a global race to fight the pandemic that has killed at least 118,000 people worldwide.

There are currently no vaccines or drugs for the new coronavirus . China, Europe and the United States are all trying to become the first to produce a vaccine , bringing a nationalist element to the race that has sometimes undermined international cooperation.

Mr. Boehler is a friend of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and began working closely with Mr. Kushner on the coronavirus response in March. This federal agency normally invests in economic development projects in other countries, Mr. Trump said at the factory. I said, 'How about investing in our country?' After the H1N1 influenza virus infected tens of millions of Americans starting in 2009, the stockpile was severely depleted, one of the officials said. It was never replenished. Mr. Trump in recent months has repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for not working to refill the stockpile. The cupboard was bare, he told ABC News last week. Asked why he didn't do more to replenish the stockpile, Mr. Trump said he had been busy, citing the Russia investigation and his impeachment trial. President Obama requested more funding for the stockpile, but his request was rejected by fiscal hawks in Congress. Senior administration officials have for weeks been discussing measures to encourage the manufacturing of crucial supplies in the U.S., while limiting reliance on other countries such as China. The effort is being championed internally by trade adviser Peter Navarro and has faced resistance from some of the president's economic advisers, according to people familiar with the matter. Business groups have warned the White House that limiting or discouraging imports of key medical supplies could lead to further shortages.

It's hard to maintain a distance from cashiers, so use self-checkout when possible and use hand sanitizer when you're done. Should I wear a mask or gloves to the grocery store? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reversed previous recommendations, advising all Americans to wear cloth face masks when out in public, which includes when in the grocery store. They don't recommend wearing the N95 respirator masks or surgical masks, which should be reserved for health care workers who are facing a shortage of protective equipment. Gloves don't help much if you're going to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with them. Rather, experts say, wash your hands with soap and water before going out and when coming home, and use hand sanitizer when out. If you use gloves, choose disposable ones and throw them before getting into your car or as soon as you get home (if you're walking or taking public transportation).

In August alone, there have been six days when Germany has registered more than 1,000 new cases. The growth is especially noteworthy because it is linked not to a single cluster, but to a general rise of infections in the population. Five districts, including one in central Berlin, reported more than 25 cases per 100,000 in the past week, according to figures released Wednesday. The seven-day reproduction value is at 1.04, meaning more people are becoming infected than are recovering. Also on Wednesday, the Bavarian authorities admitted that they had failed to promptly deliver 44,000 test results to returning travelers. Among those were 900 positive tests for the virus. The state has set up free testing centers in airports and some major train stations. The state’s governor, Markus Söder, called the breakdown in transmitting test results “really, really annoying.” Jens Spahn, the country’s health minister, warned that many of the new infections are seen in young people. The average age of infected people was 34 last week, the lowest it has been since the beginning of the pandemic. Two people in China who had seemingly recovered from the virus tested positive again. A 68-year-old woman in the Chinese province of Hubei, where the global coronavirus outbreak was first detected, tested positive again this month after recovering from a case of the virus recorded in February, officials said. Another man who had recovered from an infection in April was also found to be an asymptomatic carrier in Shanghai this week. The two cases, which came months after their original diagnoses, have revived concerns about mysterious second-time infections that have baffled experts since the early days of the pandemic, with some blaming testing flaws.

Harvard, MIT sue Trump administration over ICE foreign-student rule A lawsuit filed on Wednesday by Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology challenges the Trump administration's attempt to bar foreign students from attending colleges that will teach entirely online in the fall term. ICE announced policy changes on Monday that would keep international students from entering the U.S. or make them subject to deportation if the colleges they were enrolled in taught remotely. Many schools are planning to teach classes remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has tweeted his displeasure with the guidelines set by the CDC for school reopening, calling them very tough and expensive. Harvard President Lawrence Bacow said the ICE order was unexpected, its cruelty surpassed only by its recklessness. – Jorge L.

A record 261 new cases of the virus were recorded in the county Monday, just over two weeks after Trump's rally. An additional 206 cases were reported on Tuesday, according to the Tulsa Health Department. The past few days we've had almost 500 cases, and we know we had several large events a little over two weeks ago, which is about right, so I guess we just connect the dots, Dart said, citing Trump's rally and other protests.

{"id": 2793, "text": "That means virtually no false positives. Cassandra Kelly-Cirino, an infectious disease scientist and director of emerging threats at FIND, explained why manufacturers' claims often don’t hold up in independent testing. For one thing, results vary depending on how recently the infection occurred. The tests assessed by FIND are abysmal in detecting antibodies formed in the first few days after someone has been infected with the coronavirus , Kelly-Cirino said. For anything less than eight days, the tests have very, very poor performance,” she said. Some of the antibodies the body produces to fight COVID -19 dissipate quickly. “After about the 14-day mark, what we're seeing as well is a tail-off, where (the tests) don't work as well,” she said. Another problem is that manufacturers often use small samples to validate their tests, Kelly-Cirino said. Abbott and Ortho Diagnostics, whose tests were authorized for emergency use by the FDA, didn’t use any samples from people whose immune systems were compromised, she said. Older people and those with health conditions don't produce as many antibodies, so they're harder to detect, she said. If test manufacturers decided to exclude all patients that are falling in that area, that's because it likely would have brought their performance levels down, Kelly-Cirino said. That's a problem, she said, because those people especially need accurate tests. Testing perfection wasn't necessarily the top item on Desiree Callahan's agenda when the information technologist drove her GMC Denali up to an antibody testing site in San Diego last month. Callahan, 55, said she had a flu-like illness in late 2019 and was “just curious” to know whether she’d had a bout with COVID -19.

{"id": 2794, "text": "The Trump administration also plans to delay the April 15 tax deadline for most individual taxpayers as well as small businesses. On Wednesday, Britain's government and central bank announced a rare joint stimulus plan. The Bank of England followed the Federal Reserve in cutting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, to 0.25%, the first reduction since summer 2016. Later in the day, the U.K. government said it had earmarked up to £30 billion ($38.5 billion) of extra spending to combat the coronavirus for the fiscal year through March 2021. In Europe, economists are urging governments to increase their spending to support the eurozone's economy and take some of the strain off the European Central Bank . Germany has announced some limited fiscal measures in recent days, but German officials are philosophically opposed to deficit spending and trying to smooth out fluctuations in the business cycle.

On Wednesday, Australia had confirmed 112 cases of coronavirus , including three deaths. Australia last experienced a recession in 1991 and its 28 years of economic growth is the longest continuing streak in the developed world. However, the threat of a recession has driven the Australian dollar to its lowest level in more than a decade against the greenback, and pushed its benchmark equities index into bear-market territory on Wednesday. Around a third of Australia's exports head to China, where the coronavirus epidemic began and where measures to contain its spread disrupted production and shipments while hitting global supply chains. It is better to err on the side of being excessively stimulatory and then wind it back, than to do too little and lose confidence, Martin Parkinson, who helmed the Treasury Department from 2011 to 2014, said Wednesday.
