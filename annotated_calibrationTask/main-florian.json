SODERBERGH I think the biggest issue now is because of the resurgence [of the virus], how do we get access to the resources and the personnel that we need to run these protocols to keep a set safe? It's one thing to do one or two projects and see how it goes, but there's a movement in the last two or three weeks to get lots of productions back up and running at the same time. That's going to be tricky. With baseball, they got it back up and running but there's already been a pretty significant outbreak . Could Hollywood face the same risk? SODERBERGH Having spent a lot of the weekend very happily watching baseball, I was not happy about the Marlins , but I think that's a much more difficult situation than we're confronting because of the nature of the game and the fact that they're traveling all over the place. We have an ability on a project to control how we move, where we move, how many people come with us -- it's something that can be manipulated to keep people safe. I think if we can withstand the economic surcharge that's going to come with keeping a project safe -- which I estimate is between 15 to 20 percent of the budget, depending on the project -- and if we can scale this quickly enough, then I know we can keep people safe. If you follow these protocols we're about to finish up with, I feel pretty confident saying that you're not going to get sick at work. If you got sick on one of our projects, it was during the 12 to 14 hours when I didn't have you and I couldn't control your behavior. That's going to be the trick, is all of this downtime when you don't know what people are up to. But what happens if people do get sick in that downtime and then come to set? SODERBERGH Look, it's complex, but Joel Coen is shooting ''Macbeth'' in L.A. right now, and there's a crew member who's been [keeping] a pretty detailed diary.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": "florian"}
{"id": 2950, "text": "You contend that: the U.S. is currently better equipped to handle the pandemic because private insurers reimburse hospitals at higher rates than government-run systems elsewhere. In the midst of a pandemic and in a presidential election year, can we count on an objective appraisal of U.S. health-system results relative to those of nationalized systems? It seems more likely that the comparison that will get most media play is the U.S. system versus perfection: immediate quarantines, tens of millions of coronavirus tests in a week, a vaccine in a month and no wait times for urgent care. If the standard is quality of care in the U.K., France and Italy versus the U.S., America's system ought to shine in a crunch; but if the media standard is a flawless version of a government-run health system that doesn't exist, voters may by swayed toward making drastic changes in the U.S. system. Ryan Graham Melbourne, Fla. Regarding William A. Galston's America Wasn't Prepared for This Crisis (Politics & Ideas, March 18): A major reason for the underfunding of public-health initiatives is the overfunding of acute-care initiatives. The U.S. spends a far greater portion of its GDP on acute care than any other developed country, yet it has some of the worst public-health outcomes for a developed country. The overspending on acute care crowds out expenditures for public health. Decision makers in government tend to see public-health threats as more remote threats. The neglect of public-health initiatives leads to poorer outcomes in acute care. For example, many acute patients present with decreased lung function due to environmental or workplace pollution, or from smoking tobacco or other substances. Further, the U.S. population is one of the most overmedicated in the world, spending billions of dollars that could be better used for public-health initiatives. Failure to address principles of public health such as poor lifestyle choices in nutrition and hygiene leave us more vulnerable to Covid -19. Mr. Galston indicates that we have been caught short on both acute care and public health. That is true, but the overspending on acute care has been a factor in diminishing public health.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 2013, "end_offset": 2024, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:14.095609Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:14.095640Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 2025, "end_offset": 2039, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:25.371994Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:25.372019Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2040, "end_offset": 2102, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:31.344185Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:44:31.344213Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": "florian"}
{"id": 2957, "text": "Analysts were expecting them to be three times as high. Ryanair lived up to its reputation and managed to squeeze a decent yield out of its customers, despite having expanded capacity more than competitors. It still had to slash fares, given that the market is dominated by last-minute fliers that are only willing to buy at deeply discounted prices: Revenues per passenger resulting from bookings came in 20% below the same period of 2019. But this was partially offset by an 8% increase in ancillary revenues, as travelers chose more priority boarding and reserved seating. The airline also upheld a long tradition of cost cutting. While passengers fell 60% relative to a year earlier—planes flew only 72% full, compared with their usual 97% summer occupancy—costs per passenger excluding fuel rose only 44%. Many investors have spent months trying to gauge the right moment to come back into airlines and other discounted sectors, knowing that a rebound from the pandemic will come eventually, but aware that losses could mount before then. They should embrace the top budget carriers as a way out of this conundrum. Their ample cash buffers and low costs ensure that, no matter when the recovery happens, they will come out on top. In the U.S., Southwest Airlines is boldly planning to take corporate market share away from legacy airlines at key airports. Ryanair , however, offers something even more comforting: a return to the basics. In a troubled postcrisis aviation market, its power to cut staff and airport costs and gain market share will be much greater. So far, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has been too optimistic with his traffic forecasts. But this week's results are a reminder of what truly matters: As soon as normality returns, he always makes money.

{"id": 2995, "text": "Dr. Birx's comments, especially those dismissing ventilator shortages, startled some health experts. While most hospitals might have sufficient supplies at the moment, many worry about a crush of patients in the very near future. Dr. Howard Bauchner, the editor in chief of The Journal of the American Medical Association, warned Friday of ''a potential tsunami coming'' on a video call with hundreds of other physicians about rationing ventilators and critical care. Dr. Ryan A. Stanton, a board member at the American College of Emergency Physicians , said Dr. Birx sounded like ''the builders of the Titanic saying the ship can't sink.'' Public health officials have emphasized that regions of the country less urgently in need of more ventilators could donate some of their inventory to health systems in more desperate need, a point that Dr. Birx made Thursday night. Mr. Trump on Friday, appearing to respond to widespread criticism from various cities and states, announced that the federal government would issue contracts to buy thousands of ventilators from a variety of large and small makers. But it appeared doubtful the devices could be produced in time to help the overwhelmed hospitals. Dr. Birx has had to oscillate between occasionally competing forces on the task force, which features a set of doctors and scientists who have often registered skepticism with the White House's attitude toward coronavirus policy. In private discussions, she has joined with members of the group whom she has known for decades to push the State Department to issue an advisory against traveling on cruises. This week, she met with Drs. Fauci, Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where the group talked through concerns about the Trump administration's embrace of malaria drugs as possible treatments for Covid -19, the disease caused by the coronavirus , according to a senior administration official. Publicly, Dr. Birx has been a soothing constant next to Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in coronavirus meetings and briefings, where she has been one of the few regulars in a rotating cast of health officials perched behind the White House lectern. Mr. Pence, who is overseeing the government's response, introduced her at the time of her appointment as his ''right arm.'' But on Thursday, that delicate balance appeared to tip. After talking to New York officials, Dr. Birx said she had been told that there were still intensive care beds and ''over 1,000 or 2,000'' ventilators still available.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 230, "end_offset": 322, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:31:59.845949Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:31:59.846019Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 323, "end_offset": 329, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:03.644415Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:03.644446Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 337, "end_offset": 371, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:22.112521Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:22.112543Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 468, "end_offset": 553, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:30.521002Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:30.521035Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 554, "end_offset": 558, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:33.585633Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:33.585674Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 559, "end_offset": 640, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:41.310796Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:41.310830Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 873, "end_offset": 882, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:59.548512Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:32:59.548534Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 971, "end_offset": 985, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:33:05.553955Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:33:05.553976Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 986, "end_offset": 1103, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:34:25.195949Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:34:25.195970Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 2284, "end_offset": 2339, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:02.365825Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:02.365856Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 2340, "end_offset": 2354, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:45.839749Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:45.839801Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2386, "end_offset": 2408, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:54.906911Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:38:54.906937Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 2501, "end_offset": 2509, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:01.410688Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:01.410736Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 2510, "end_offset": 2514, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:05.117981Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:05.118031Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2515, "end_offset": 2631, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:09.598630Z", "updated_at": "2021-05-21T06:39:09.598669Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": "florian"}

Politicizing the regulatory process — tying the authorization and approval of treatments to political considerations — undermines the entire system. On Saturday, the president accused the F.D.A. of deliberately thwarting the development of a coronavirus vaccine in an effort to imperil his re-election.

If you test positive in Washington, D.C., where I work as a family physician and professor at Georgetown University School of Medicine, you should expect a call from a contact tracer working for the city's Department of Health. That is true in many other cities and states as well. It is important that you cooperate with the contact tracer and describe all those with whom you have come in contact before testing positive, so that efforts can be launched to quarantine them, test them if needed and stop the spread of the disease. Most universities would like to know whether you test positive even if you don't live on campus or come to campus for classes (and are studying only online). Find out what the reporting methods are for your school and help out by disclosing your test results. 4. When should I be in self-isolation? If you tested positive or are sick with covid -19, you will be asked to self-isolate. This can be hard, especially if you live with housemates. Isolation is more restrictive than quarantine. You will need to stay in your room for 10 days after a positive test, eat in your room, try to avoid sharing a bathroom with others and not go out for anything, except medical care.

Proteins are long chains of amino acids folded into different shapes. Each amino acid is encoded by three genetic letters, but in many cases a mutation to the third letter of a trio will still encode the same amino acid. These ''silent mutations'' don't change the resulting protein. ''Non-silent'' mutations do change a protein's sequence, and the Guangzhou sample of the coronavirus did acquire two non-silent mutations. But proteins can be made of hundreds or thousands of amino acids. Changing a single amino acid often has no noticeable effect on their shape or how they work.

But until a vaccine or an effective treatment for Covid -19 becomes available, social-distancing efforts will limit the number of workers allowed on factory floors, likely restraining production. Only in China, the first major economy to begin reopening after the novel coronavirus outbreak, did factories report an increase in activity. But the surveys suggested that its nascent economic recovery is already beginning to stall, with export orders falling sharply amid continued global efforts to contain the pandemic. The surveys indicate the worst might be over for manufacturers, and activity could start to increase in coming months. But the road back to the levels of output and employment seen at the end of last year is set to be long and bumpy. Whether growth can achieve any serious momentum remains highly uncertain, however, as demand looks set to remain subdued by social-distancing measures, high unemployment and falling corporate profits for some time to come, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, the data firm that compiles most of the surveys outside the U.S. In many countries, factory managers reported that restrictions on movement continue to make it difficult for them to operate at normal levels of output. But they also reported that weak demand is holding them back, with new orders continuing to fall. In a sign that factories don't expect conditions to improve rapidly, many reported further job cuts. In India and South Korea, those reductions in payrolls were the largest on record. One problem highlighted by the surveys is that even where local restrictions have been removed, or were never very severe to begin with, the return to normality is being impeded by weak export demand. China—the first country exposed to the virus—entered lockdown earlier than other countries. It also exited its lockdown earlier, but May surveys of purchasing managers pointed to a large decline in export orders. That was also true of South Korea, which chose not to impose mandatory lockdowns and focused instead on widespread testing and tracing of those infected by the virus, and the people with whom they had come into contact.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 47, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:25.153674Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:25.153756Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 49, "end_offset": 53, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:29.190644Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:29.190670Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 54, "end_offset": 167, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:35.556484Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:51:35.556511Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 922, "end_offset": 1144, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:14.370117Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:14.370146Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1146, "end_offset": 1151, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:17.663233Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:17.663259Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1151, "end_offset": 1273, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:26.114833Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T18:52:26.114859Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

{"id": 2948, "text": "But pretty good. Mr. Trump disputed the virus's estimated death rate given by the World Health Organization , citing his hunch that it was lower. He said a vaccine may be ready within months, despite doctors, drug company executives and his own administration's health officials telling him that it was at least a year away. He said that coronavirus tests were available for anyone who wants one, which was inaccurate then and remains so a week later. That's not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or, frankly, almost anywhere in the world, Mr. Azar said about the president's remark on March 10. The president also has personalized the crisis, focusing closely on market declines, which he ties directly to his prospects for re-election. Last week, he didn't want a Carnival Corp . cruise ship with sick passengers aboard to dock on the West Coast because of how it would reflect on him. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship, he said March 6. That wasn't our fault. The ship eventually docked. The president also has spent weeks playing down the disease. On Feb. 26, he told reporters that there were only 15 people infected and the total within a couple days is going to be down to close to zero. He also was reluctant to sign off on the first virus-related travel ban aimed at China, concerned about the signal it would send to markets and his relationship with President Xi Jinping, aides said. He eventually agreed to it on the advice of Mr. Azar, aides said, and now touts it as one of his proudest actions during the crisis.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 17, "end_offset": 26, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:33.097989Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:33.098420Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 27, "end_offset": 35, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:41.252676Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:41.252712Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 36, "end_offset": 145, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:50.066354Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:50.066389Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 146, "end_offset": 148, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:54.124578Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:54.124752Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 148, "end_offset": 153, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:57.175266Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:29:57.175292Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 154, "end_offset": 325, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:03.791661Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:03.791688Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 325, "end_offset": 327, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:07.737227Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:07.737253Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 328, "end_offset": 337, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:11.147291Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:11.147317Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 338, "end_offset": 450, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:15.322764Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:15.322801Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 452, "end_offset": 554, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:23.416615Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:23.416640Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 556, "end_offset": 564, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:27.044457Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:27.044484Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 565, "end_offset": 569, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:34.642760Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:34.642784Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 903, "end_offset": 963, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:46.244888Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:46.244914Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 965, "end_offset": 967, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:51.819584Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:51.819608Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 967, "end_offset": 973, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:54.875874Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:30:54.875907Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1106, "end_offset": 1108, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:47.334651Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:47.334694Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1109, "end_offset": 1113, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:50.402457Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:50.402486Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1114, "end_offset": 1235, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:58.677960Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:31:58.677986Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1437, "end_offset": 1490, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:19.521493Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:19.521517Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1491, "end_offset": 1496, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:26.329682Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:26.329708Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1497, "end_offset": 1501, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:46.313244Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T19:32:46.313271Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2949, "text": "Late last month, Bacow said in a statement that he and his wife, Adele, tested positive for the coronavirus , and would take time to rest during their quarantine period. Since then, Bacow said Saturday they are doing well and are regaining their strength. He has started running again, though he said he is careful to take routes where he is unlikely to encounter other runners and has a mask ready to pull up if he does. Both have volunteered to participate in a research study at the Ragon Institute to have their blood drawn and their antibodies harvested for therapeutic use. “We hope that something good can come from our close encounter with COVID -19, Bacow said. Bacow also thanked well-wishers for their support during the couple's quarantine. “Your expressions of hope and encouragement — and the many, many ways in which you are meeting the challenges of the pandemic in cities around the world — reminded us every day of how extraordinarily caring the Harvard community is, he said. Bacow said that on campus, when most students were asked to return home before spring break due to the outbreak, volunteers stepped forward to help make travel arrangements and pack belongings “because they care about our students. Faculty and staff also worked to move their courses online midway through the semester, he said. “These examples are just two of many that demonstrate a kind of selflessness revealed only by crisis, and I have witnessed it more times than I can count over these past four weeks, Bacow said. A Harvard faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital has also worked between her hospital shifts to help create a HarvardX online course on mechanical ventilation, which Bacow said is training about 40,000 health care workers worldwide. Two vaccines to enter clinical trials have ties to researchers at Harvard, he said. “If you haven't already, I hope you will take a moment to learn about the ways people across the University are mustering all of their generosity and ingenuity — their grit and determination — to meet a challenge that binds us together even as it casts us apart, he said.

{"id": 2953, "text": "In a video statement released Saturday evening from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Trump said, I'm starting to feel good. You don't know over the next period of a few days, I guess that's the real test, so we'll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days. Several days after symptoms of COVID -19 appear, the body's immune system must make an important switch to fight the virus with precision – or possibly face life-threatening consequences. Watch: Dr. Sean Conley did not answer several questions regarding Trump receiving oxygen COVID -19 patients can “look pretty good for a few days, then they go south,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Rapid deterioration can occur when the body's immune system, unable to target the virus, causes widespread collateral damage as it “brings in the troops,” Schaffner said. A typical timeframe for patients' decline is five to 10 days after the person starts getting sick, said Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a professor of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Washington school of medicine in Seattle. Conley said Saturday that Trump was in his third day of fighting the virus. During the early part of a patient's COVID -19 illness, the body uses an agnostic immune response, said Dr. Greg Poland, director and founder of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group. It doesn't know what it's fighting but realizes something potentially dangerous is occurring. That's called the innate immune system. Key to a successful recovery is an adaptive immune system response that targets the coronavirus . To avoid serious illness, a patient's innate and adaptive immune systems must stay in balance, and the virus must not cause serious complications along the way. Age is a risk factor. Older patients tend to be less successful in activating the adaptive response, according to Melissa Nolan, an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of South Carolina.

Comparable retail sales at its non-U.S. locations fell 48% in the fiscal third quarter, which ended May 31. The business of processing and filling prescriptions is generally a stable one, but Covid -19 also has taken its toll on that front: New prescription starts have declined as patients chose to forgo medical care. New prescriptions can account for up to a quarter of total annual prescriptions filled at a retail pharmacy, according to analysts at Mizuho Securities . As a result, both CVS and Walgreens trade at about 8 times adjusted earnings, a bargain-basement valuation in a pricey market. But there is a potential solution to their traffic woes in plain sight. For starters, there is reason to expect the chains to benefit from a stronger influenza-vaccination effort than normal. Drugmakers are shipping 200 million flu shots this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . That is a record and up 13% from a year ago. Pharmacies that offer the shots should benefit from greater traffic. Many workers who were vaccinated at their offices will now use this option.

{"id": 2958, "text": "The pandemic is also eroding the secrecy that pervades academic medical research, said Dr. Ryan Carroll, a Harvard Medical professor who is involved in the coronavirus trial there. Big, exclusive research can lead to grants, promotions and tenure, so scientists often work in secret, suspiciously hoarding data from potential competitors, he said. “The ability to work collaboratively, setting aside your personal academic progress, is occurring right now because it’s a matter of survival,” he said. One small measure of openness can be found on the servers of medRxiv and bioRxiv, two online archives that share academic research before it has been reviewed and published in journals. The archives have been deluged with coronavirus research from across the globe. Despite the nationalistic tone set by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Chinese researchers have contributed a significant portion of the coronavirus research available in the archive. Though Chinese officials initially covered up the outbreak and have since used it for propaganda purposes, Chinese scientists have in many ways led the world’s coronavirus research. A Chinese laboratory made public the initial viral genome in January, a disclosure that formed the basis for coronavirus tests worldwide. And some of today’s most promising clinical trials can trace their origins to early Chinese research on the disease. Few areas of the world have been spared. Last year, Jamal Ahmadzadeh, an epidemiologist at Urmia University in Iran, warned that the world needed a rapid-alert system in response to MERS, another coronavirus . No country was immune to the risk, he wrote. In an email last week, as Iran grappled with one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, he wrote that defeating the virus required information-sharing across laboratories and across borders. Even scientists working in fields beyond infectious diseases have been drawn into the effort. Dr. Perrone, who is supervising an Italian clinical trial of the immunosuppressive drug tocilizumab, is a cancer specialist.", "annotations": [{"label": 46, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 81, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:32.786890Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:32.786923Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 82, "end_offset": 86, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:37.847287Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:37.847315Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 87, "end_offset": 181, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:43.288218Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:43.288244Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 181, "end_offset": 339, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:51.207748Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:51.207774Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 339, "end_offset": 341, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:59.968924Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:43:59.968951Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 342, "end_offset": 346, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:03.398802Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:03.398850Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 348, "end_offset": 492, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:09.668506Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:09.668532Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 492, "end_offset": 494, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:12.664167Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:12.664193Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 495, "end_offset": 500, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:16.891629Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:44:16.891655Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1600, "end_offset": 1634, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:18.148240Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:18.148268Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1635, "end_offset": 1637, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:22.826634Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:22.826661Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1638, "end_offset": 1643, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:27.937258Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:27.937294Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1442, "end_offset": 1506, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:37.669588Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:37.669624Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1507, "end_offset": 1518, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:42.484772Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:42.484806Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1519, "end_offset": 1599, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:50.988515Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:50.988546Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1738, "end_offset": 1740, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:58.082369Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:45:58.082396Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1741, "end_offset": 1752, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:46:01.280265Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:46:01.280291Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1752, "end_offset": 1841, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-27T06:46:07.368142Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-27T06:46:07.368168Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The former CNN producer's company, Lead Stories, helps Facebook Inc . and other social-media platforms limit the spread of virus misinformation by flagging it as false. Business is booming, thanks to a surge of posts that are both dangerous and harder to track than many other forms of fake news. The claims that Lead Stories debunks are then labeled as false on Facebook , which limits their spread and links to Lead Stories' reviews. A staffer combs the platform looking to identify and label duplicates that spring up. Already ramping up with funding from Facebook to combat misinformation in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Mr. Duke and others in the industry have pivoted to coronavirus almost full-time. We've maxed out all our goals for the month, he said halfway through March, referring to the company's contractual targets for Facebook fact-check volumes. Lead Stories continues to review Facebook and Instagram content, and review material from Twitter , YouTube and other platforms that don't pay it, posting fact checks to its own site. Since its first virus fact check in mid-January, Lead Stories has fact checked more than 200 viral coronavirus claims. Other fact checkers have become similarly focused, organizing an ad-hoc task force to identify misinformation that has hopped national borders as quickly as the virus itself. While many virus posts carry international content, they generally appear to be noncommercial, produced by pranksters or people promoting misguided home remedies, Mr. Duke said. The content is often memes and images rather than purported news stories. And where Lead Stories has become used to complaints from the publishers of stories it rated as false, it now hears from regular users upset that it has debunked a meme they shared.

Parents across the city who chose hybrid learning said they felt reassured knowing they could eventually switch to all-remote, something the city allows them to do at any time. Fatima Flores-Goya in the South Bronx is one of those parents. She admits that choosing full-time remote instruction would have prevented some of the stress she experienced when the city twice delayed reopening classrooms last month. But she's not ready to opt out just yet. Though she can do her work from home, Ms. Flores-Goya finds herself exhausted from a full day of caring for her three young children, ages 6, 9 and 12. Putting her children into hybrid instruction provides her with at least a few days to focus on herself, she said. ''I'm still wary with all the news and the slow closings in other 'hot spots,' '' she said. But she added that she remains confident ''that teachers and students alike are taking every precaution necessary in the school.'' Three blocks away, her younger sister, Veronica Flores, is having a better time with remote learning for her 11-year-old daughter than she expected. Ms. Flores originally placed her daughter in a middle school near her office in downtown Manhattan so that the two could commute together. But then Ms. Flores's job as an auditor went remote.

The announcement comes amid debate over the safety of teachers and residents if schools and universities were to open while cases around the country continue to surge. The Florida Education Association , the state's largest teacher's union, sued the governor over his plan to reopen schools in the fall. On Wednesday, the Kansas Board of Education rejected Gov. Laura Kelly's executive order that would have delayed the opening of schools. Local school districts can make their own decision on when to open, according to the decision.

And the White House has previously adopted a number of mitigation measures, even though they wouldn't completely halt the virus. Why draw the line for advocacy and compliance on masks, which are notably a much simpler mitigation tool than closing down portions of the economy? The second is that the standard Meadows is setting up here is completely nonsensical. There is literally no panacea for the coronavirus — nor will there be even when we have a vaccine . Redfield acknowledged as much in testimony Wednesday, noting that the vaccine won't work for everyone. He said the immunogenicity may be 70 percent, and if I don't get an immune response, the vaccine 's not going to protect me. By Meadows's standard, would taking the vaccine not necessarily be worth it either, if you have only a 70 percent shot at immunity? That quote brings us to our third point. When Redfield gave it, he was actually propping up masks as a potentially more effective mitigation tool than a vaccine . I might even go so far as to say this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when I take a covid vaccine , Redfield said, because the immunogenicity may be 70 percent and if I don't get an immune response the vaccine 's not going to protect me. This face mask will. Redfield later clarified that a vaccine will be hugely important because it's the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life. But he said, The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds.

And though digital support is no substitute for the physical community that he’s missing, it’s still nice to see people laugh. “The fact that it did catch on made me happy because it essentially showed there’s a place for more hopeful messages; that dark humor isn’t the only way we can express ourselves,” Mr. Perry said, before laughing. “It was also fun to see everybody think I was high, too.” Dan Wyatt, the owner of the Kiggins Theater in Vancouver, Wash., has also been updating his marquee to match the phases of quarantine. Following his first two messages — “Goonies never say die” and “Keep your distance, Chewie, but don’t look like you’re trying to keep your distance” — Mr. Wyatt decided to reference his favorite movie, “Back to the Future.” “Cinema was always — for me — about hope and optimism,” Mr. Wyatt said. “You always hope these marquee messages going out will resonate the same way, or create the same effect that people have while sitting together and watching a movie communally and sharing those emotions.” His single-screen theater has since caught the eye of many housebound movie fans, with Michael J. Fox — who played Marty McFly in the “Back to the Future” trilogy — reposting a photo of the marquee himself. Since then, Mr. Wyatt has tried out two new messages: A play on different Tom Cruise movies and a reference to The Princess Bride. “I think there’s a communal experience that goes beyond the budget spectacle,” Mr. Wyatt said. “If you have a $100,000 movie theater in your home, it still does not compare to sitting elbow to elbow with people, and enjoying those experiences together,” he continued. “A comedy is going to be funnier, and an exciting adventure is going to be that much more exciting when it’s watched communally.” Matthew Viragh, the founder of The Nitehawk Prospect Park in Brooklyn, left three parting messages on the theater’s marquee when it closed on March 14. For the last two months, the front has read “Now Showing: Onward,” referencing the animated movie that debuted shortly before quarantine began. Though there’s no end in sight yet, he’s sure that the community will flock back to theaters once it’s allowed. “People really do enjoy going to the movies and getting out of their apartments and being with people in general — that’s why you live in New York, right?” Mr. Viragh said. “For all the culture, all the food, and all of the time spent with friends.” The other two sides of the Nitehawk’s marquee say “see you on the other side” and advise passers-by to “Be excellent to each other” — a message from “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure” (1989) that has been written on theater marquees around the country.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 0, "end_offset": 77, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:38.130446Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:38.130860Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 78, "end_offset": 83, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:42.221113Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:42.221149Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 83, "end_offset": 177, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:47.320753Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:47.320794Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 305, "end_offset": 484, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:54.596934Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:54.596966Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 485, "end_offset": 494, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:57.711220Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:16:57.711246Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 495, "end_offset": 517, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:01.444330Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:01.444356Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 518, "end_offset": 575, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:05.736913Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:05.736940Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 935, "end_offset": 990, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:42.778291Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:42.778332Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 991, "end_offset": 1000, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:52.879869Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:52.879894Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1001, "end_offset": 1006, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:57.427377Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:17:57.427403Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1007, "end_offset": 1212, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:03.103907Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:03.103934Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1550, "end_offset": 1628, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:14.574606Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:14.574633Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1629, "end_offset": 1638, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:17.946052Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:17.946077Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1639, "end_offset": 1643, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:21.018901Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:21.018931Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1645, "end_offset": 1803, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:34.522391Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:34.522417Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1804, "end_offset": 1806, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:41.734877Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:41.734902Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1807, "end_offset": 1816, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:44.976426Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:44.976452Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1818, "end_offset": 1947, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:53.252334Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:18:53.252368Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2356, "end_offset": 2512, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:14.521170Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:14.521204Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 2512, "end_offset": 2522, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:18.531039Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:18.531074Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 2523, "end_offset": 2527, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:21.678285Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:21.678317Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2529, "end_offset": 2605, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:28.539044Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T13:19:28.539072Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

The remark prompted a swift rebuke from Mr. Biden's campaign and, hours later, from the former vice president himself. Mr. Biden, a Catholic, described his faith as the ''bedrock foundation of my life'' that sustained him after he lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident, and later, his adult son Beau Biden to cancer. ''For President Trump to attack my faith is shameful,'' Mr. Biden said, calling it ''beneath the office he holds.'' He added that the attacks ''show us a man willing to stoop to any low for political gain, and someone whose actions are completely at odds with the values and teachings that he professes to believe in.'' Mr. Trump maintained that Mr. Biden frequently is confused about his whereabouts, during a speech in which the president mispronounced Thailand as ''Thighland,'' catching himself a short time later. The president spoke as his aides struggled to get a deal for new legislation to help people suffering economic pain caused by the coronavirus , something Mark Meadows, his chief of staff, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, have been scrambling to achieve in negotiations with Democratic leaders. Mr. Trump has not been a meaningful part of the talks, preferring to comment from the sidelines. After a fund-raiser on Thursday evening in Ohio, he will head to his private club in New Jersey and has fund-raisers scheduled this weekend. Mr. Trump's swing through Ohio took him to Clyde, where he toured a Whirlpool factory. The president wore a mask as he walked through the plant, giving a thumbs-up sign to photographers nearby, a notable move given his longstanding resistance to the masks until the past few weeks. Mr. DeWine has been a proponent of masks; he issued a statewide order requiring them last month. Then, standing at a lectern with the presidential seal, his face glistening with sweat, Mr. Trump delivered a winding series of remarks that were ostensibly about trade and the economy, but that took several detours into criticizing Mr. Biden and complaining about his political lot in life.

The draft proposes the safety and effectiveness standards that a Covid -19 vaccine would need to meet for the FDA to permit use, called an emergency-use authorization because the agency plans to issue the decision on an accelerated. If the Trump administration signs off on the guidelines, it would make it difficult for a vaccine to be authorized for emergency use before Election Day, the people said.

Mr. Azar and other administration officials didn't raise serious objections to the proposals during a meeting Tuesday, people familiar with the matter said.

For example, espionage campaigns could derail vaccine trials if hackers access confidential information, even if the data isn't manipulated, said Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at the University of Oxford. Many countries already designate health care as a critical infrastructure sector. In some places, that means companies are required to implement certain cybersecurity measures and report attacks to authorities and can receive government assistance or information about threats. Elsewhere, health care isn't deemed critical infrastructure. Kubo Macak, a legal adviser at the International Committee of the Red Cross, advocates stronger protections for health care.

Cuomo said that the two counties on Long Island as well as the Mid-Hudson region, which includes Westchester and Rockland Counties, could move into the first phase of reopening if virus-related deaths continued to decline and contact-tracing programs were ready to go. In anticipation of reopening, construction staging can begin next week, Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have indicated that New York City was unlikely to begin reopening until June. The city has already met four of Mr. Cuomo's criteria, tracked on an online dashboard. Two that it did not satisfy as of Friday involved the capacity of the health care system to handle a surge in cases. The city still needed to have at least 30 percent of its hospital beds and at least 30 percent of its intensive-care-unit beds available. The city fell three percentage points short on conventional beds and two percentage points short on intensive-care beds. Mr. de Blasio has pegged the city's reopening to three metrics: the number of new hospital admissions, the number of patients in critical care and the percentage of positive coronavirus tests. He said on Friday that the city would not reopen until it had a 10-to-14-day period with under 200 daily hospitalizations of suspected Covid -19 patients, fewer than 15 percent of the population testing positive and fewer than 375 patients in the intensive-care units of the city's public hospital system. The city has met the first two requirements. But he said the number of intensive-care patients was too high, at 451.

{"id": 2970, "text": "How can you blame one individual for everything?” Djokovic didn’t seem any more eager to accept responsibility for Sunday’s meltdown. Though he later posted an apology on Instagram and seemed to be sincere in his concern for the woman who was injured, he left the premises without talking to the media. On ESPN, commentator Patrick McEnroe hammered Djokovic for not addressing it right away. You only have to go back to 2017 when Denis Shapovalov got disqualified under similar circumstances while playing for Canada during a Davis Cup match. Shapovalov was 17 at the time and had the humility to go in front of the press and say he was “incredibly ashamed and embarrassed.” Would it really be that hard for the best player in the world to do the same — especially when what happened Sunday was a logical extension of what Djokovic has done many times on the court over the years when he lets frustration get the better of him. “Djokovic has been doing things like this for many years,” McEnroe said on ESPN. “Of course he didn’t do this on purpose, but he was in control of what he did. What he did was wrong, and he has to pay the price, which is walking out of here. “He’s done this multiple times. When you do that, you’re playing with fire and he did it one too many times.” But the manicured apology to come isn’t going to win Djokovic many hearts and minds. Maybe there was a scenario where tennis fans warmed to him as Federer and Nadal faded into the sunset and Djokovic chased history as the lone man left on the stage. Instead, 2020 has hardened his image as the spoiled spoiler. That’s not the legacy the best player ever should be carrying around. Follow USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken.

{"id": 2972, "text": "The executive orders President Trump has signed in recent days to fill the gap don't address testing, and he has said testing is a problem for the states. We can still get this right, says Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation , which first proposed a national testing program in April. But it requires a paradigm shift. As a nation, the U.S. now is doing 4.5 million tests a week; the Rockefeller Foundation plan calls for ramping that up to 30 million. Given that it likely will be four months or more before a vaccine is available, the incentive to improve testing remains high. More Capital Journal * Five China Questions for Candidate Biden (Aug. 3) * The Debate Over Systemic Racism: Why It Divides and Why It Provides Hope (July 27) * Trump Hunts for Hidden Voters—but Biden Does, Too (July 20) We need, above all, an effective national testing strategy—something the nation sorely lacks today, the foundation said in the latest update of its plan. Here is a real-life story that illustrates where we are: A man was scheduled to go on a week's family vacation at the beginning of the month, and, in an attempt to be sure it was safe to gather, all family members took coronavirus tests in advance. Because the vacation was planned for Massachusetts, which requires a test within 72 hours before visitors arrive in the state, the test was scheduled three days before the start of the vacation. Those three days passed with no test result provided. Then the full week of vacation came and went, still with no result. Twelve days after the test was taken, and after family members had dispersed back to their homes, there still was no result. If the man actually was carrying the virus, he had no way of knowing.

{"id": 2973, "text": "Mr. Kantesaria added that he's expecting weakness in parts of the economy, but remains broadly optimistic about a recovery. Still, some of the confidence that drove major indexes higher earlier in the week abated Thursday as investors parsed new data showing that about 2.4 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 16, continuing a sharp deterioration in the labor market. On Friday, some of the simmering tensions between the U.S. and China escalated, weighing on global stocks. The Hang Seng Index closed down 5.6% in its worst day since July 2015 after China moved to impose new national-security laws on the city. China scrapped its economic growth target  for 2020 in a stark acknowledgment of the challenges facing the world's second-largest economy, sending crude oil and metal prices sharply lower. Anything that knocks China's growth rate, whether it's a slower recovery from the coronavirus or a rise in tensions with the U.S., will weigh on global growth expectations,'' said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors . Beijing's decision to omit a formal target comes amid the sharpest contraction in four decades precipitated by a sudden halt in manufacturing activity because of the coronavirus pandemic. The nation's policy makers are signaling that they won't rush to introduce additional stimulus measures, which suggests more economic pain for countries that have become increasingly reliant on China as an engine of growth. China's proposed national security law would challenge the financial hub's autonomy and threatens to increase tensions with the U.S. Congress condemned the move, with senators promising an urgent push on legislation that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials and institutions involved in undermining Hong Kong's Western-style rule of law. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 0.659% on Friday from 0.640% last week as bond prices rose. Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.6% on Friday to $35.13 a barrel. Copper, a closely watched metal for its use in industrial activity, slipped 1.8%. China is today the biggest importer of crude oil, so Chinese growth is hugely important for oil demand,'' said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB.

{"id": 2974, "text": "This is misleading. A report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services in the early days of the pandemic found serious problems with the supplies shipped from the strategic national stockpile. “Some hospitals noted that at the time of our interview they had not received supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile, or that the supplies that they had received were not sufficient in quantity or quality,” the inspector general wrote. One administrator stated that getting supplies from the stockpile was a major challenge, saying that the supplies the hospital received “won’t even last a day. We need gloves, we need masks with fluid shields on — N95 masks — and we need gowns.” “Days after taking office, we … ended the unfair and very costly Paris climate accord and secured for the first time American energy independence.” False. While President Trump did withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement — a move that was not legally initiated until 2019 — the pact, which includes nearly every other nation on earth, remains intact without the participation of the United States. It is not accurate to say that the United States is “energy independent,” a phrase that suggests that the United States is independent of reliance on imported energy sources. In 2019, nearly half the oil consumed by the United States was imported — about 9 million barrels per day were imported of the roughly 20 million barrels per day that were consumed, according to the Energy Information Administration , the statistical arm of the Energy Department. “I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president.” False. Not according to historians. Among modern presidents, historians agreed that the most significant legislative achievements belong to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act. A 2017 study that assessed modern presidents based on the analysis of editorials published in Black newspapers ranked Mr. Johnson at the top. Mr. Trump would place in the bottom third, the study’s co-author told the Times. “We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner.” Exaggerated.

The administration can provide the Biden team with intelligence briefings and access to government agencies even as the president pursues his legal challenges. This failure to cooperate is unthinkable in the face of a growing, increasingly unattended, pandemic. While we still have a short time to avoid the worst, the clock is ticking. As an example, the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed, an ambitious joint Pentagon and Department of Health and Human Services effort to develop and distribute coronavirus vaccines once these medicines receive approval for safety and effectiveness. The success of this effort will be driven by our government's ability to get 300 million coronavirus shots into the arms of the American people. Americans would be better served if the Biden team were engaged today. Not tomorrow, today. I've seen failure of this kind take a toll before. As I flew into New Orleans by helicopter on Sept. 6, 2005, the devastation from Hurricane Katrina defied description. It was as if the city had been hit by a weapon of mass destruction; New Orleans remained underwater and literally ungoverned a week after the storm made landfall. Beyond the immediate need for rescue, food, water and shelter, there was a loss of continuity of government, including the inability to establish command and control over efforts to help alleviate immense suffering and needless death.

{"id": 2976, "text": "The list will be updated again Sept. 7. D.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said Monday that the city is seeing a higher proportion of coronavirus cases among residents between the ages of 20 and 30 than before July 1. She also said the city is far from advancing to Phase 3 of its reopening plan. She said officials knew in June that Phase 2 would be a much longer haul than Phase 1. One of the primary holdups to lifting additional restrictions, she said, is that many new coronavirus cases have no known connection to other cases, with no clear origin. Nesbitt said some activities originally planned for Phase 2 could be allowed before the transition to the next phase, including in-person schooling and more entertainment options. There's still a host of activities that we delayed in Phase 2 because our indicators weren't exactly where we wanted them to be, she said. Phase 3 would imagine us having mass gatherings at much higher levels, would imagine us having a different level of telework, would increase capacities of some of the indoor activities we're having. Montgomery County on Monday lifted some pandemic restrictions, including allowing bowling alleys and museums to reopen. Officials also reclassified soccer from a high-risk to a medium-risk sport, which means scrimmages and games will now be permitted. As the District prepares for a week of protests, the pandemic is temporarily sidelining a group of Virginia activists after three people tested positive for the virus. FXBG Free, which has held anti-racism protests in Fredericksburg after the police killing of George Floyd, said in a message posted to social media that the positive cases, first reported by the Free Lance-Star, were a temporary setback.

The Biden administration will aim to bolster trust in scientists at U.S. health agencies, according to the people familiar with the talks between the campaign and the companies. Some people affiliated with the Biden campaign have proposed that changing the Warp Speed moniker could increase public confidence, according to two of the people. Some U.S. health officials and pharmaceutical executives have suggested the name has sowed doubt in the products it is backing. The Warp Speed name stuck after Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics, Evaluation, and Research, pitched it as an homage to Star Trek. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, later said in an interview with PBS in August it was unfortunate terminology and tends to subliminally suggest reckless speed. Warp Speed officials have said that the name isn't intended to signal haste. We are not cutting corners on safety; we are not cutting corners on the quality of the manufactured product; those will be done to the highest standards, Matthew Hepburn, the program's head of vaccine development, said at a talk at the Heritage Foundation last month. Slaoui, the former head of GlaxoSmithKline Plc 's vaccines division, was contracted to serve as Warp Speed's chief scientific adviser in May. His contract extends through February. The Moroccan-born Belgian-American immunologist said in an interview with Axios last month that he hasn't had contact with the Biden camp. He told Axios he would like to remain in his role until two vaccines and one or two new treatments are approved. Biden representatives have also contacted a group representing local health officials, who emphasized the importance of coordinating virus response through city and county health departments, instead of relying solely on elected officials. “We asked to keep in touch if they should win the election and how we might be helpful moving forward,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.", "annotations": [{"label": 44, "start_offset": 796, "end_offset": 881, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:22.993233Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:22.993270Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 882, "end_offset": 927, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:28.066476Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:28.066512Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 928, "end_offset": 1008, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:36.038273Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:36.038309Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1009, "end_offset": 1029, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:42.643369Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:42.643404Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1030, "end_offset": 1044, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:46.218701Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:27:46.218739Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1045, "end_offset": 1084, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T14:28:02.642822Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T14:28:02.642857Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1086, "end_offset": 1238, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:25.066314Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:25.066820Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1240, "end_offset": 1299, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:28.924919Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:28.924946Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1300, "end_offset": 1304, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:32.345856Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:05:32.345881Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1535, "end_offset": 1582, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:06.818394Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:06.818430Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1583, "end_offset": 1587, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:13.569167Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:13.569199Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1631, "end_offset": 1672, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:23.394273Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:23.394301Z"}, {"label": 44, "start_offset": 1674, "end_offset": 1676, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:27.366780Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:27.366808Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 1677, "end_offset": 1681, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:29.949117Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:29.949143Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 1688, "end_offset": 1786, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:34.073966Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:06:34.073991Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2027, "end_offset": 2130, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:39.275624Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:39.275653Z"}, {"label": 45, "start_offset": 2131, "end_offset": 2135, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:42.209998Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:42.210025Z"}, {"label": 46, "start_offset": 2136, "end_offset": 2246, "user": 7, "created_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:45.700381Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-30T15:07:45.700407Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2979, "text": "Two years ago, 12 Russian intelligence operatives were indicted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated both Moscow and President Trump. They have also evaded trial. The president closed two Russian diplomatic facilities that the United States said were dens of spies operating under diplomatic cover, and ordered more evictions. Yet the hacking and the disinformation operations have proceeded unabated, and by some measures have accelerated. “There is no doubt that China represents a tremendous espionage threat for the United States,” said Abraham M. Denmark, who runs the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a senior Defense Department official. “The question here is not China’s culpability — I expect it’s solid — but rather if suddenly closing the consulate in Houston will address the problem.” It probably won’t, most cyberexperts inside and outside the government concede. After years of trying to figure out how to deter cyberattacks — by naming and shaming, indicting and sometimes even counterattacking — the problem of halting attacks that remain short of war is proving far more complex than deterring nuclear holocaust. “Our problem is that we have to be much more clear about what actions we won’t tolerate and what the consequences will be,” said Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who served on the congressionally created Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which recommended a series of steps to increase deterrence this year. When it comes to defending against cyberattacks, Mr. Langevin said, the Obama administration was overly cautious and the Trump administration “is too often shooting from the hip.” In fact, both presidents have often used the same tools — mostly drawn from a 19th-century diplomatic playbook that is being applied to a 21st-century challenge. It shouldn’t be a surprise that it isn’t working. It is a reminder of two things. First, in the cyberage, closing a diplomatic facility has the faint ring of the Cold War, but most of the attacks on American corporations, laboratories and the government are launched from servers outside American borders. And second, without firing a bullet or dropping a bomb, an adversary can deliver a crippling setback to the United States by infiltrating American computer networks, whether the target is the design for the F-35 warplane or a potential coronavirus vaccine . To Mr. Trump’s credit, orders he issued two summers ago have resulted in more aggressive pushback, what the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command call a strategy of “defend forward.” That means they go deep into an adversary’s computer networks, sometimes to strike back, but more often to signal that an attack will not be cost-free. “The central issue is that they need to know they will pay a price,” Mr. Langevin said.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

This fall, Ms. Travis and the parents of several of her son’s friends decided to create some semblance of school. “We podded up,” she said. In addition to Outschool classes, Ms. Travis hired a retired teacher to go to their homes once a week and augment the public school’s history and English curriculum. And a trainer from a local gym conducts physical education classes twice a week in a driveway or garage. The cost of these learning pods varies, and Ms. Travis said hers was $40 per week per child for the teacher and the fitness trainer. Outschool classes average $10 per class, and families in financial need can access classes free through the company’s nonprofit arm, Outschool.org. “The pandemic has launched the largest educational innovation experiment in the history of mankind,” says Sujata Bhatt, a senior fellow at Transcend, a national nonprofit that helps communities and school districts create innovative, equitable learning environments. Parents are increasingly turning to microschools — very small schools that usually have a specific culture — and learning pods. Microschools can be based outside or inside a home, and may or may not be state-approved and accredited. Learning pods are generally ad hoc and home-based, most having been created this summer in response to public school closings. (The Pandemic Pods Facebook page has more than 41,000 members.) Like the one Ms. Travis started, learning pods are often a mix of the public school’s remote curriculum, supervised care and enrichment activities. “So much personal growth takes place in school,” Ms. Travis said. “My son needed to be learning with other kids.” True microschools, however, predated the pandemic.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2981, "text": "Dr. Trump used his instinctive grasp of medicine to become the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency with an innate life expectancy of 200 years. To the relief of millions, this extremely stable genius has turned to the challenge of solving the novel coronavirus , or as Dr. Trump spells it in the Latin, Caronavirus. Early on in the outbreak, Dr. Trump was among the first to determine that the virus miraculously goes away in April. Dr. Trump's pathbreaking epidemiology enabled him to determine that the World Health Organization 's report that 3.4 percent of reported cases of the virus have died is a false number. Trump's research, based extensively on my hunch, puts the true figure at way under 1 percent. Related research by Dr. Trump found spread of the virus is not inevitable, that cases in the United States are going very substantially down — and that they are all getting better. This informed Dr. Trump's reclassification of the coronavirus as a new hoax by Democrats — though he later clarified that the illness itself was not the hoax, only Democrats' attempts to blame him. In fact, Dr. Trump's DNA research has determined that neither he nor bats nor pangolins caused the virus's spread but rather President Barack Obama. The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing, Trump disclosed, a finding that eluded experts. Given the reduced virulence that Dr. Trump discovered, he concluded there could be hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work — though he NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. But even if they did, Dr. Trump's pharmaceutical advances have put us very close to a vaccine , within months — about a year ahead of other experts' forecasts. This breakthrough is possible because while other medical authorities have classified coronavirus as novel, Dr. Trump has determined that this is a flu and he renamed it the corona flu. Therefore he suspects that a solid flu vaccine  would have efficacy, and we'll essentially have a flu shot for this. I really get it, Dr. Trump said while visiting the Centers for Disease Control Friday, again crediting his super-genius uncle.

When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So, I said to my people, 'slow the testing down, please,' he said. The White House has given mixed responses to the comment. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at a press briefing Monday that the president was joking and that he didn't direct his staff to slow the rate of testing. Mr. Trump, asked Tuesday outside the White House whether he was kidding with the remark, said: I don't kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear. Later on Air Force One en route to Phoenix with the president, Ms. McEnany said he was making a serious point but he was using sarcasm to do that. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday in an online interview with TIME that the president clearly said that in jest. In no way is it the president's policy or our policy to slow down testing, Mr. Mnuchin said. Dr. Fauci said last weekthat while more testing results in more cases, higher percentages of positive tests in many states cannot be explained by increased testing. Federal health leaders defended the pandemic response at the hearing and said the administration's focus on testing is also about getting the country to reopen. Testing will be important for guaranteeing that each state has the testing supplies and capabilities they need to reopen according to their own individual state plans, Adm. Giroir said.

Fisman, another University of Toronto epidemiologist who helped us assemble this model, noted that aggressive interventions must be put in place early to be most effective -- and yet early in an epidemic the public may not be concerned enough to embrace such measures. ''Early in the epidemic it is very difficult to muster the political will to implement costly, disruptive disease-control policies,'' Dr. Fisman said. ''What we are hoping to show here is that the calculus is one of short-term pain for long-term gain: Early, aggressive social distancing can substantially reduce the toll of epidemics.'' There are many uncertainties, including whether warmer weather will reduce infections, as happens with the seasonal flu. If so, we could see a respite this summer, and then a resumption of cases in the fall (that's what happened in 1918 with the Spanish flu pandemic). In addition, there are a number of treatments that are being tested and may prove helpful against the coronavirus . These are not accounted for in the model. On the other hand, shortages of protective equipment like masks and chaos in hospitals may lead to higher death rates; the United States also has an older and thus more vulnerable population than China, from which much of the data comes. President Trump declared a ''national emergency'' over the pandemic and announced steps to make testing easier. He seems belatedly to be taking the virus more seriously, but at this point we may already have many tens of thousands of infections in the United States -- no one knows, because testing has been so badly bungled -- and the number of cases is probably doubling every six days or so. Public health specialists say we need a huge expansion of testing, preferably drive-through, plus major curbs on public gatherings, suspension of school in affected areas and intensive preparations so that hospitals can still function as infections soar. Overburdened I.C.U.s are one of the biggest risks.

The post was later shared publicly online, and Mr. Johnson said he has since received several threatening phone calls and emails. We were villainized overnight, he said, adding that he regrets the tone of his post. We weren't trying to say we don't care or that the virus is something to not take seriously. Mr. Johnson said local officials had ordered restaurants to keep tables at least 6 feet apart -- a mandate that some of his restaurants aren't large enough to support -- and to prohibit patrons from sitting at restaurant bars. I don't know if we're going to make it through this, said Mr. Johnson, who has since closed the company's restaurants after Washington, D.C., officials ordered all eateries to cease table service Monday.

Rappaport said building the Level 3 labs can cost anywhere from $75 million to $100 million. Some primate centers are upgrading their facilities to bio bubbles, using existing structures to comply with requirements without having to build a lab from scratch. It's a way that they've been able to use existing space and convert it quickly, said Sally Thompson-Iritani, the Director of the Washington National Primate Research Center. Currently the bio bubbles are in such high demand because there are other facilities looking for that. Thompson-Iritani inquired about a bio bubble for her research center in Washington state and was told it would be six to nine months before she could get in touch with someone to evaluate her facility. While experts say there's little that can be done to fix the shortage of monkeys and lab space for COVID -19 research, there's still time to prepare for the next pandemic. Primate centers and other institutions require more funding to expand breeding colonies and build labs, they say. Bohm said some research centers have discussed the possibility of an animal reserve available when some unforeseen emergency comes up.

In Pfizer’s early phase trial, more than half of the vaccinated participants experienced headache, muscle pain and chills. If the vaccines ultimately provide no benefit beyond a reduced risk of mild Covid -19, they could end up causing more discomfort than they prevent. Third, even if the studies are allowed to run past their interim analyses, stopping a trial of 30,000 or 44,000 people after just 150 or so Covid -19 cases may make statistical sense, but it defies common sense. Giving a vaccine to hundreds of millions of healthy people based on such limited data requires a real leap of faith. Declaring a winner without adequate evidence would also undermine the studies of other vaccines , as participants in those studies drop out to receive the newly approved vaccine . There may well be insufficient data to address the aged and underrepresented minorities. There will be no data for children, adolescents and pregnant women since they have been excluded. Vaccines must be thoroughly tested in all populations in which they will be used. None of this is to say that these vaccines can’t reduce the risk of serious complications of Covid -19. But unless the trials are allowed to run long enough to address that question, we won’t know the answer. The trials need to focus on the right clinical outcome — whether the vaccines protect against moderate and severe forms of Covid -19 — and be fully completed. It is not too late for the companies to do this, and the Food and Drug Administration , which reviewed the protocols, could still suggest modifications.

Dr. Pei wasn't involved in the research. To determine whether college reopenings influenced case counts in the larger community, the researchers used cellphone GPS tracking data to look at the movements of people—including an influx of students—and calculated the infection rates of the surrounding county from mid-July to mid-September, before and after students showed up. They found little uptick in case counts for those communities where students moved back to be near campus, but were taking classes online. The biggest surge came near schools with in-person instruction, with particular spikes in places where students came from hot-spot zones elsewhere in the country. Many institutions grappled with whether to reopen dorms and hold classes in person, or keep lessons online as they had done in the spring. Some started back up with limited testing protocols in place or minor changes to residence halls, while others are requiring weekly swabs from even asymptomatic individuals. The finding that colleges drawing students from higher-risk areas experienced a larger increase in cases is critical for planning mitigation strategies in colleges, Dr. Pei said. Within weeks of opening, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University reverted to online instruction and sent students home because of outbreaks of Covid -19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus . The University of Wisconsin-Madison , the University of Colorado Boulder and the University of Arizona have urged students to hunker down and shifted classes online, for at least a few weeks, to try to stem the virus's spread. We're not saying it was a terrible mistake to open, said Ana Bento, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Indiana University and co-author of the study. Just that the influx of individuals, which was much greater where there is face-to-face [instruction], is correlated with a larger increase in cases. She added: Decisions to reopen are far more complex than just the question of, 'Will cases increase or not?' The study analyzed case numbers from all U.S. counties.

Officials from government agencies and nonprofit organizations working to address skepticism about vaccines warned that huge challenges loom after clearance of a vaccine , relaying skeptical quotes from listening sessions conducted with Black, Hispanic and Native American communities. I firmly believe that this is a Tuskegee experiment, said one participant in a listening session organized by the Reagan-Udall Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Congress to advance the FDA 's mission. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an infamous study in which Black men who had syphilis were not told they had the disease and treatment was withheld from them while researchers watched the progress of the disease. Vaccines take years to develop and test. For them to try to do it in a year is pretty absurd, another participant said. Committee members also debated whether and how an emergency use authorization could complicate or disrupt clinical trials, including whether people in the placebo group should be given access to the real vaccine . The FDA reiterated Thursday that it wants companies to keep their trials blinded even after an authorization, to continue collecting important data. Once a decision is made to unblind an ongoing placebo-controlled trial, that decision cannot be walked back, and that controlled follow-up is lost forever, Fink said. But some vaccine makers, including Pfizer , have said that that position might not be ethical — and that individuals in placebo groups should be notified that a vaccine has been authorized and be allowed to receive the vaccine . As an industry, we have an ethical obligation to make our trial participants aware that a vaccine may be available, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization , which represents biotech companies, said in comments filed to the committee. The advisory panel, called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, is made up mostly of academic experts in infectious diseases, immunology and biostatistics.

How the diagnosis may affect Biden’s campaign The news from the White House surprised Mr. Biden’s campaign, which learned of the positive tests from news media reports and not from the Trump campaign. Mr. Biden, his wife, and Senator Kamala Harris of California, Mr. Biden’s running mate, all tested negative for the coronavirus in the past 24 hours. There are, of course, several ways the diagnosis causes uncertainty for Mr. Biden. In tone and substance, the former vice president will have to restructure portions of his campaign to seem in step with the moment. * The next presidential debate: The Biden campaign has been cautious about the candidate interacting with the public. However, even with limited in-person events, the Biden campaign will now have to decide how to proceed with the next presidential debate, which is scheduled for Oct. 15. That timeline is most likely too soon for someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus just two weeks before. Maybe a debate over Zoom? * Tone down the attacks: It is unlikely that Mr. Biden will reach for his same arsenal of attacks on Mr. Trump and his administration while the president is experiencing a health crisis. This week, after the debate in which Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump “the worst president” America has ever had, there was some hand-wringing by both parties about the number of personal attacks leveled by each candidate. That has already changed Friday, as Mr. Biden’s campaign pulled its negative advertisements and the candidate did not attack Mr. Trump during a visit to Michigan. * Focus on the affirmative message: This week, Mr. Biden’s campaign quietly announced it was resuming in-person canvassing, after months of arguing that it could reach voters without such methods. This could be a time for Mr. Biden and his new canvassing army to focus on making the pro-Biden case for the White House, distinct from his case for removing Mr. Trump.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Levels of neutralizing antibodies were 1.8 to 2.8 times the level of that in recovered patients. It's not certain that higher antibody levels will lead to immunity to the virus. To prove that, Pfizer will need to conduct large studies that aim to prove that people who have received the vaccine are at least 50 percent less likely to become infected. Those studies are expected to begin this summer, mostly in the United States. Pfizer is testing four different versions of the vaccine , but only one will advance to larger studies. The current study did not include pregnant women, and no other information on the ethnic diversity of participants was noted, although the paper does say that future studies will need to include a more diverse group. The second dose, a booster shot, was required for immunity. The patients who received the single 100-microgram dose had lower antibody levels than those who received two shots of the lower doses.

More are expected to start soon, including entrants from Merck, Johnson & Johnson , and Sanofi . In total, 178 vaccines are in various stages of development.
