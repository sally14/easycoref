{"id": 2696, "text": "There is some evidence that US intelligence gathering out of Wuhan, China, found the first signs of what would become the pandemic as early as last November. Of course, the parallels break down when the warnings reached the Oval Office. There is simply no president who has ever been as cavalier about his responsibilities, and indifferent to the lives of the American people, as Donald Trump. The president was briefed about the virus, and even told journalist Bob Woodward in February that it was “deadly stuff, but chose to actively mislead the American people instead of organizing a response. Yes, the devastation caused by COVID -19 is certainly a “shock, but it too “should not have come as a surprise. Not when the president of the United States repeatedly lies to the American people, insisting that a virus will “just go away — and life will return to normal — maybe by Easter. Remember that? Or maybe by September and kids will be back in school. Or maybe by Election Day, when surely there will be a vaccine , no? When the president waits until there is a full-blown crisis in much needed medical supplies to invoke the Defense Production Act, he has failed to protect the public. When he bends trusted public health institutions to his will to promote phony “cures or ineffective treatments, he is endangering the people of this country. And when he fails to promote common-sense protections like wearing masks, he fails in the most basic role of a leader. When one day this nation is on the other side of this pandemic, there needs to be a way to memorialize those who lost their lives in a tragedy made worse by failures of leadership. But there is one more lesson from the 9/11 Commission Report that should not be lost on a nation now sorely divided among the mask-wearers versus non-mask-wearers, believers versus deniers. “We call on the American people, the commission wrote in 2004, “to remember how we all felt on 9/11, to remember not only the unspeakable horror but how we came together as a nation — one nation.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 394, "end_offset": 407, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.317503Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.317531Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 441, "end_offset": 492, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.318657Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.318679Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 492, "end_offset": 512, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.319563Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.319584Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 718, "end_offset": 754, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.320391Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.320411Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 794, "end_offset": 808, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.321300Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.321318Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 809, "end_offset": 886, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.322102Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.322119Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1197, "end_offset": 1200, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.322872Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.322889Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1257, "end_offset": 1264, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.323618Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.323635Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1265, "end_offset": 1351, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.324517Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.324534Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1874, "end_offset": 1888, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.325262Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.325279Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1889, "end_offset": 1903, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.326020Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.326035Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1841, "end_offset": 1874, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.326757Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.326772Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1903, "end_offset": 2036, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.327768Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.327797Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

We have an aggressive surveillance program that routinely monitors online sources for health fraud products, especially during a significant public health issue such as this one. The FDA has created a cross-agency task force to watch for fraudulent coronavirus products, including FDA and FTC monitoring of social media and online marketplaces. There is no vaccine or drug to treat the coronavirus or COVID -19. People who believe they may have contracted the coronavirus should not use these products as a substitute for seeking appropriate medical treatment for the virus, the FDA says. “There already is a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus ,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “What we don’t need in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims. These warning letters are just the first step. We’re prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam. ” Last Week Tonight, the late-night HBO comedic news show hosted by John Oliver, included a clip from The Jim Bakker Show in its March 1 report on coronavirus .

{"id": 2699, "text": "“Even if you like tech as a sector, this recession has been incredibly tech friendly,” he said. “It’s difficult to continue at this level.” Mr. Paolini also pointed out that market leadership always changes from one bull run to the next. “It has never happened in the past that the top performer of one bull market is the top performer in the next one,” he said. Tech was a robust performer for stock fund investors in the third quarter. The average portfolio that concentrates on the area rose 11.5 percent, according to Morningstar . Funds that focus on consumer cyclicals and energy also had double-digit gains. Domestic stock funds gained 7.1 percent, on average, in the quarter, and international stock funds rose 7.7 percent. The average bond fund increased 2.3 percent. The tendency for market leadership to change may be a reason to lighten up on tech but not necessarily to buy cyclicals. Mr. Paolini would consider buying cyclicals when the economy is able to grow without government intervention and bond yields start rising, developments for which a coronavirus vaccine might be a catalyst, he said. His observation about bull market leadership works geographically, too.

But that was not his message yesterday, in his first major policy speech as president-elect.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 653, "end_offset": 701, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.410641Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.410658Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 703, "end_offset": 707, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.411400Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.411416Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 707, "end_offset": 755, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.412143Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.412158Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 891, "end_offset": 900, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.412892Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.412907Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 900, "end_offset": 971, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.413627Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.413642Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1517, "end_offset": 1551, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.414368Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.414384Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1589, "end_offset": 1604, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.415163Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.415178Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1552, "end_offset": 1588, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.415906Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.415921Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2704, "text": "Some industry watchers have posited that commuters will avoid public transit during the virus scare. For example, Doug Anmuth, an analyst with JP Morgan who follows ride-hailing companies, wrote in a research note that shares of Lyft could go up because “people would be more likely to use rideshare than a crowded bus or subway, though Lyft may also be hurt by a decrease in overall travel, especially to airports. In Massachusetts, there has been one confirmed case of coronavirus , from a Boston resident, and one presumptive case. Boston public health officials said the person with the confirmed case has not left his home since being diagnosed. The state's public health department also said that residents who are under self-quarantine — currently, more than 250 people — should call health authorities before traveling if they feel ill. The T's initiative to clean station surfaces every four hours began Wednesday, MBTA spokeswoman Lisa Battiston said, up from once a day. She added that the work does not require more workers beyond existing in-station staff and cleaning crews, “though staffing needs will continue to be reviewed with increases to staff where necessary. “This effort is not a deep-clean of the entirety of the station, but a targeted focus on high-contact areas including things like fare vending machines, push bars on doors, elevator buttons, and hand rails of stairways and escalators, Battiston said. Poftak cautioned that the cleaning schedule depends on getting enough commercial-grade disinfectant on hand. Right now, the agency has enough to clean every commuter rail car each day; he estimated that by the end of this week, the T will be able to disinfect subway cars, buses, and paratransit vehicles daily. In addition to increased cleaning, the MBTA will be installing hand sanitizer dispensers in stations, and the agency will display information related to the coronavirus on messaging boards in stations and on trains, Poftak said. Officials with the Massachusetts Port Authority , which operates Logan Airport, said at the news conference that they are also focusing on regular cleaning of traveler areas.

{"id": 2705, "text": "“Congress should come together and pass a Covid relief package” along the lines of the $3 trillion bill that House Democrats passed earlier this year. Mr. Biden said that combating the virus remained the most urgent matter, however, and called on President Trump to begin the transition process quickly. “More people may die, if we don’t coordinate,” he said. Mr. Biden also said that he wanted to see a mask mandate in the United States, reiterating his request for state and local officials to require citizens to wear face coverings as cases surge during the cold winter months. Aiming fire at the Trump administration, he criticized the president and his advisers for attacking leaders of states like Michigan who have imposed new restrictions on businesses to contain rising case numbers. “What the hell’s the matter with these guys?” Mr. Biden said. “It’s totally irresponsible.” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, speaking before Mr. Biden, said they were focused on “opening this economy responsibly and rebuilding it so it works for working people.” Earlier on Monday, Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris spoke with business and union leaders to discuss the recovery, including Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors; Sonia Syngal, the chief executive of Gap; Satya Nadella, the head of Microsoft ; Richard Trumka of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Rory Gamble, president of the United Auto Workers. “They represent very different perspectives, but I’m convinced we can all come together around the same table to advance areas of common ground,” Mr. Biden said. He underscored the importance of unity between business leaders and unions and said that unions would have more power under his watch. Mr. Biden said he supported a robust stimulus package such as the $3 trillion bill that House Democrats passed earlier this year, and he insisted that funding for states and cities needs to be included in such legislation. The president-elect said that sick leave and money for child care were also priorities, arguing that people should not have to choose between working and caring for others. His speech came at a perilous moment for the recovery. Credit card data and other indicators suggest that consumers began to pull back spending this month as infection, hospitalization and death rates from the virus surge nationwide. States have begun to impose new restrictions on economic activity in an effort to tamp down the spread.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 151, "end_offset": 160, "user": 2, "created_at":

{"id": 2706, "text": "Because most have signed long-term leases and the questions they're asking are difficult to answer, the impact on owners and lenders has not been as severe as on the hotel or retail sectors, whose loan delinquencies are at record highs. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=InfogramEmbeds,d=e.getElementsByTagName(script)[0];if(window[t] window[t].initialized)window[t].process window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(script);o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js,d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,infogram-async); Whereas 24% of all hotel loans and 18% of all retail loans sold in the commercial mortgage-based securities market fell into delinquency in June, only 2.7% of office building loans suffered the same fate, according to Cushman Wakefield , the commercial real estate services firm. The office market, it's like a slow motion car wreck, said Christopher Marinac, director of research with Janney Montgomery Scott , a financial advisory firm based in Atlanta. I see heavy uncertainty on the future demand for office space. It takes a lot longer for an office building owner to default on a loan, explained Jason Vanslette, a mortgage foreclosure litigation specialist with the Kelley Kronenberg law firm in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Owners sign leases with multiple tenants and a good amount would have to stop paying rent at the same time for owners to get in trouble with lenders. Still, the slowing economy from COVID and the existential question of whether employees can continue working from home over the long term means the office sector will continue to struggle for the next two years, Vanslette said. As it stands now, about 14% of office space is vacant across the country, up from 12.8% last year, according to Cushman Wakefield . And vacancy rates are expected to reach at least 17% – if not higher – by 2022, according to the firm's estimates – rates not seen since the Great Recession. !function(e,i,n,s){var t=InfogramEmbeds,d=e.getElementsByTagName(script)[0];if(window[t] window[t].initialized)window[t].process window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement(script);o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src=https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js,d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,infogram-async); Rents are also expected to fall by more than 5%. According to a recent survey compiled by the DLA Piper law firm, large cities, including Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco – with their high-rise buildings and dependence on mass transportation – are expected to suffer more than smaller cities as residents and companies flee. But John Sullivan, chairman of DLA Piper 's U.S. real estate practice, said it would be wrong to count out big cities just yet. It's hard to determine what's permanent and what's not in the middle of a crisis, Sullivan said. After 9/11 and those horrifying pictures of planes hitting the World Trade Center, a lot of people predicted the death of high-rise office buildings. That was an understandable sentiment, but it obviously proved false in the long term.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 798, "end_offset": 859, "user": 2, "created_at":

{"id": 2707, "text": "Jay Inslee moved to prohibit gatherings of 250 people or more across three counties. And King County, where at least 234 people have tested positive and 26 have died, plans were made to ban events with even fewer attendees unless they meet certain health guidelines. Our state needs a more vigorous and more comprehensive and more aggressive position if we are going to slow the spread of this epidemic, Mr. Inslee said. Seattle Public Schools, the state's largest school district with 104 campuses and more than 53,600 students, said it would close all schools for at least 14 days, starting Thursday. Last week, Northshore School District in the city's northern suburbs directed students to stay home—a measure, officials said Wednesday, that has so far proved effective. The moves follow similar containment measures in Europe and Asia. China, where the outbreak began in December, has all but declared victory over the disease as the number of new cases has dropped sharply after the country's hard-line response to the pathogen. China's National Health Commission on Wednesday reported 24 new infections, 10 of them imported—highlighting how the epidemic has evolved and shifted. Iran confirmed 63 new deaths, the highest single-day toll there since the new coronavirus appeared three weeks ago, as total infections reached 9,000. Japan reported its second-biggest one-day rise in confirmed cases thus far, taking the country's total to 568. South Korea—trailing only China, Italy and Iran in cases—reported 242 more Wednesday, bringing its total to 7,755. In Italy, where the largest outbreak outside of China pushed the country to implement an unprecedented nationwide quarantine, the number of cases climbed Wednesday to 12,462, with 827 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. France's confirmed cases jumped by 500 Wednesday to 2,281, Health Minister Olivier Véran said, with 48 total deaths and 105 people in intensive care. In Germany, cases increased to 1,908 and officials said they expected the number to rise. As long as there is no immunity in the population, no vaccines and no therapy, then a high percentage of the population—experts say 60% to 70%—will become infected, said German Chancellor Angela

{"id": 2708, "text": "This hypothesis is supported by the fact that exposure to the first wave provided up to 89 percent protection against second wave illness (the best vaccine in the last 15 years provided 62 percent protection), but neither first nor second wave exposure protected against that third wave. What does all this mean now? Nothing is certain and little is known about Covid -19, but a few things are likely. First, modelers estimate that the true number of infected persons is up to 20 times the reported number, which still leaves about 95 percent of the population susceptible. If, as in 1918, susceptibility proves more important than seasonal influences, hot weather will not give as much relief as hoped for. By the same token, that would mean the expected seasonal surge when colder weather arrives might not be as large as feared. Second, Covid -19 mutates much more slowly than influenza, and its key spike protein — the part of the virus that attaches to cells — seems particularly stable. Amid all of the bad news that this virus has brought, this characteristic of the virus is a silver lining in several ways. Since the virus does not mutate nearly as fast as influenza, this reduces almost to zero the chance that it will become more virulent, as happened in 1918. Moreover, because the spike protein is a key part of the virus likely to be recognized by the immune system, then mutation will probably not account for a new wave soon. For the same reason, the consensus view of virologists seems to be thatthose who recover from the illness probablydevelop immunity lasting a year and possibly longer, and that avaccine will most likely protect reasonably well against Covid -19. Third, the incubation period, on average nearly six days, is roughly triple the average incubation period of influenza, and the disease itself takes much longer for people to recover from and stop shedding virus. Therefore even without social distancing it would take months for the outbreak to pass through a community, as opposed to six to 10 weeks for influenza. With social distancing — necessary to reduce deaths by keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed — it will take even longer. Additionally, the incubation period allows an asymptomatic person more opportunity to spread disease.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 409, "end_offset": 417, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.526340Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.526355Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 418, "end_offset": 426, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.527055Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.527070Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 426, "end_offset": 572, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.527799Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.527815Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1463, "end_offset": 1497, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.528538Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.528553Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1497, "end_offset": 1513, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.529297Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.529312Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1513, "end_offset": 1685, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.530149Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.530166Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2709, "text": "Those elite performers: the referees. The study's authors noticed that in stadiums without fans, the behavior of the games' supposedly neutral arbiters shifted dramatically. And only by playing games in silence could the researchers determine how officiating calls were inherently biased by the mere presence of other human beings. But even after they published their results, they wished they had more data. It would take a pandemic for them to get what they wanted. Our little study is becoming relevant again, said Mikael Priks, who wrote the paper with Per Pettersson-Lidbom, his University of Stockholm colleague. Now sports leagues around the world are confronting the bleak reality of playing behind closed doors to come out of hibernation. Major League Baseball is considering a plan that would put teams in a bubble to play games in Arizona. The NBA and NHL are weighing similar proposals to stage their postseasons. German soccer is hoping to resume play in empty stadiums in early May. A future without fans is the only feasible option that public-health experts can see until there is widespread testing or a vaccine . There is reason to believe that these events will have dramatic implications on the games themselves. This is the first time in the modern history of sports that they won't have drunk fans calling them blind, telling them how to do their jobs and generally trying to influence their decision-making. For decades the question of home-court advantage has pulled at researchers, but only recently have they discovered that it's largely a function of psychology. In their 2011 book Scorecasting, Toby Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim presented compelling evidence that it's mostly a matter of referee bias.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 38, "end_offset": 57, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.530913Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.530930Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 57, "end_offset": 71, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.531674Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.531691Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 71, "end_offset": 173, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.532434Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.532449Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 518, "end_offset": 617, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.533196Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.533212Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 513, "end_offset": 517, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.533982Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.533998Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 467, "end_offset": 511, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.534738Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.534755Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1309, "end_offset": 1319, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.535474Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.535489Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1340, "end_offset": 1353, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.536223Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.536239Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1353, "end_offset": 1430, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.537025Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.537041Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1590, "end_offset": 1657, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.537769Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.537786Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1658, "end_offset": 1667, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.538502Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.538517Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1668, "end_offset": 1729, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.539279Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.539295Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2710, "text": "The Latest on the Coronavirus * Johns Hopkins : 100,330 cases of infection world-wide, 3,408 deaths * U.S. has 233 cases, 14 people have died * South Korea reports 6,593 cases Seeking to balance people's desire to discuss the virus with its own efforts to ensure misinformation doesn't get out of hand, Facebook said in a statement that it is working to remove coronavirus -themed groups and pages from its algorithmically generated recommendations and will reduce how much attention is directed to posts in groups that share misinformation. The company said it is also looking at other ways to connect people in groups with credible information and is seeking feedback from group administrators. Facebook has had experience combating public-health misinformation. Last year, the company said it would delete hashtags and suppress antivaccination groups that routinely spread falsehoods, though it hasn't released information about how often such erasures have occurred. That effort was informed by a longstanding consensus of major health organizations about what constituted vaccine misinformation, something that isn't available in the face of a novel and evolving epidemic. Open to virtually all users with an interest in discussing the coronavirus , some of the newly formed Facebook groups have grown to more than 50,000 members in a matter of weeks. More than 120 groups now exist on the platform with coronavirus in their name, and a review shows they regularly mix discussion of mainstream news stories with apocalyptic forecasts and information incompatible with mainstream news reports and official public health statements. Along with making predictions of mass death within the U.S. from the virus, users have posted videos recommending people protect themselves with face masks made of paper towels, shared dubious video footage of the streets of Wuhan spattered with blood from supposed coronavirus victims and repeated false allegations that Chinese patients are being cremated alive. Last month the WHO lamented an infodemic in which excessive chatter makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. Some of the Facebook groups appear to be commercially motivated, with organizers hawking surgical masks, purported immune-boosting zinc lozenges or other preparedness products. Facebook has traditionally sought to take a light touch to groups, which Mr. Zuckerberg has described as a way for communities to organize around shared interests. The groups tab was made more prominent in a substantial redesign of the website and mobile app last year. Groups are at the heart of the app, Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last year. He said that the company had a responsibility to discourage people from joining conspiracy-minded groups, but that If people really seek it out on their own, fine. In addition to the groups on coronavirus , another hundred pages describe themselves as communities, media outlets or health information resources, and act as similar forums for discussion.",

{"id": 2711, "text": "Although Italy is one of the global hot spots for the coronavirus , and two Massachusetts residents are presumed to have the illness after returning from trips there, some passengers who disembarked from a sparsely filled flight from Rome on Thursday said they were asked only cursory questions by US Customs Service workers at Logan International Airport. “Like, where you went or where you had been, said one of a group of students traveling home from a high school trip cut short. A friend of hers said she wasn't even asked those questions as she came through customs. The students, who like nearly all of the travelers who spoke with the Globe declined to give their names, said US Border and Customs Protection agents did not advise them of the self-quarantine guidance. The group of four was picked up at the airport by two of their mothers. Some public health specialists say that even intensive screening for the coronavirus at airports is not enough to limit its eventual spread. “It's not a perfect system, said Cyrus Shahpar, the former team lead of global rapid response at the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “That's why a lot of studies that have looked at it have [found] we can't say we have a system in place to prevent any leaks in the country. Passengers traveling from Italy and South Korea, each designated by the US government with a Level 3 travel advisory, do undergo a preboarding medical screening in those countries that includes having their temperature taken, a policy announced by the Trump administration several days ago. The passengers who arrived in Boston on Thursday confirmed they were tested in Rome. If passengers show symptoms prior to boarding, they may not be allowed to fly, according to the airline Alitalia , which had a direct flight between Rome and Boston Thursday afternoon. The airline also said it distributes pamphlets from the CDC on flights “containing information to travelers that local authorities recommend, as a precaution, a 14-day voluntary home quarantine. Upon landing, US Customs officials said, travelers may be diverted for further examination if they show symptoms of illness. “CBP's role is to identify individuals who have traveled from or transited through affected countries, spokesman Michael McCarthy said. “If individuals are observed with symptoms of Covid -19 we will continue to work with the CDC to determine if a traveler is a possible public health risk by referring them for enhanced screening.", "annotations": [{"label": 29, "start_offset": 167, "end_offset": 250, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.568319Z",

Congress is in talks about adding more funds, but an agreement doesn’t seem imminent. The distribution was patchy, according to a Bloomberg analysis, with the first-come-first-served program doling out loans to cover more than 70 percent of small-business payrolls in Nebraska and North Dakota, but less than a quarter in California and New York. • Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist of RSM, says that the program will need $1 trillion to meet demand. The rollout of stimulus checks is also fraught. Some people who received relief payments via direct deposit this week discovered that their banks seized some or all of the money because their accounts were overdrawn, reports The Times’s Emily Flitter. • After Emily’s story came out, USAA said that it would pause collections for 90 days on overdrawn accounts. Bill Gates in the cross hairs The Microsoft co-founder has spent years and billions of dollars fighting the spread of disease, including the coronavirus . But his criticism of President Trump’s response to the pandemic has now made him a target of conspiracy theories, Dai Wakabayashi, Davey Alba and Marc Tracy of The Times report: “In posts on YouTube , Facebook and Twitter , he is being falsely portrayed as the creator of Covid -19, as a profiteer from a virus vaccine , and as part of a dastardly plot to use the illness to cull or surveil the global population.” Misinformation about Mr. Gates is now the most widespread of all coronavirus falsehoods tracked by Zignal Labs , The Times reports. Should companies be paying dividends right now? As executives face a deep recession, many have cut spending, furloughed staff members and stopped buying back shares to help save cash. But many companies are still paying dividends, the subject of increasingly heated debate. Companies have a “moral imperative” to pay dividends, Keith Skeoch, the C.E.O. of the asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen , told CNBC. On the other hand, Chris Hughes of Bloomberg Opinion is unconvinced: “A board’s duty is to the overall interest of the company, not to one portion of its shareholder base.” The big American banks are keeping their dividends, their C.E.O.s made clear in earnings reports this week, even after they scrapped buybacks.", "annotations": [{"label": 31, "start_offset": 213, "end_offset": 242, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.621534Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.621549Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 242, "end_offset": 255, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.622273Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.622289Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 255, "end_offset": 276, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.623005Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.623021Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 278, "end_offset": 473, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.623768Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.623784Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 477, "end_offset": 523, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.624577Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.624594Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 523, "end_offset": 533, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.625330Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.625347Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 533, "end_offset": 581, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.626128Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.626145Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 808, "end_offset": 833, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.626880Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.626895Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 800, "end_offset": 807, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.627619Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.627635Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 630, "end_offset": 799, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.628376Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.628393Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 867, "end_offset": 871, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.629132Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.629148Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 872, "end_offset": 881, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.629905Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.629921Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 881, "end_offset": 943, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.630808Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.630824Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1213, "end_offset": 1268, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.631714Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.631731Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1269, "end_offset": 1275, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.632476Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.632493Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1277, "end_offset": 1513, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.633235Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.633254Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1626, "end_offset": 1637, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.633991Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.634007Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 1637, "end_offset": 1644, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.634759Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.634774Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1513, "end_offset": 1625, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.635510Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.635527Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 1973, "end_offset": 2042, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.636277Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.636294Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 2044, "end_offset": 2054, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.637022Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.637038Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 1920, "end_offset": 1972, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.637795Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.637811Z"}, {"label": 29, "start_offset": 2074, "end_offset": 2108, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.638621Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.638638Z"}, {"label": 30, "start_offset": 2108, "end_offset": 2124, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.639420Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.639437Z"}, {"label": 31, "start_offset": 2124, "end_offset": 2228, "user": 2, "created_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.640191Z", "updated_at": "2021-04-26T15:50:59.640207Z"}], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}
{"id": 2714, "text": "Two of these trials—one by Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC and the other by Johnson & Johnson —have paused in the U.S. because of unexplained illnesses among participants. Stuart Neil, a professor of virology at King's College London, said he expects the multiple Phase 3 trials currently under way to begin generating efficacy data by December or January. I should imagine we'll see the results of those dribbling out, he said. We cannot cut corners, and we cannot be seen to be cutting corners. No coronavirus vaccine is likely to be effective at close to 100%, which is why public confidence in it and resulting high levels of vaccination in the population at large would be critical for ending the pandemic. We have to take vaccine development extremely seriously and cautiously, said Prof. Luke O'Neill, an immunologist at Trinity College Dublin . The risk is that, if they have a safety problem, this will threaten vaccinations for any disease. The U.A.E. last month became the first country outside of China to approve emergency use of a vaccine developed by state-owned China National Pharmaceuticals Group, or Sinopharm, after the Gulf monarchy tested it on 31,000 volunteers of 125 nationalities in Phase 3 trials. Since then, several thousand workers most at risk of contracting the virus have received the vaccine , with more getting a shot every day, a U.A.E. official overseeing the trials said. The U.A.E. has moved much faster than Russia with the vaccine 's rollout. In Russia, some 2,000 front-line personnel have been administered the Sputnik V vaccine since August, and some 13,000 people have enrolled in ongoing Phase 3 trials, just over one-third of the number in the U.A.E., people familiar with the project said.

{"id": 2715, "text": "Why didn't health-care providers offer telemedicine years ago? Structural and engineering solutions are often the most cost-effective public-health policies because in addition to keeping people healthy, they save time and energy. For this reason, structural and engineering changes can be used against a broad spectrum of future threats because they pay for themselves in other ways. Vaccines don't usually offer nonmedical payoffs. Gregory O. Ginn, Ph.D. Austin, Texas --- Catastrophes require a much wider response than usual, typically the combined efforts of multiple government agencies plus all their many industry contacts/partners. But to get multiple agencies to put forth today's budget for an undefined future response (on which various agency experts will argue strenuously) is very difficult. The public often becomes a key response element in a catastrophe and this one is no exception. Not only do they need to be convinced to wear masks, a culturally unfamiliar act, and to understand the list of risky behaviors, but this needs a steady repetition to get everyone on board. To be fair, no one knows the future, so no planning efforts will ever be perfect. Even a well-coordinated interagency plan at the federal level would have had gaps based on the actual disease. And the feds really can't make the states conform to their planning. The appearance of a certain amount of unreadiness is inevitable. Luckily people are smart and flexible. No doubt there will be detailed reviews done at many agencies and serious oaths will be sworn to improve in the future, but until the motivation for interagency coordination changes and includes willingness to partner with businesses and the public at large, the planning done for our response to catastrophes is unlikely to change our usual state of unreadiness.

But they are experts without, for the most part, the most fundamental tool in medicine — solid evidence upon which to base their decisions. When the coronavirus appeared in the United States in late January, hopes were high for quick progress: Science would find a treatment for people with the illness and develop a vaccine to prevent future cases. Today, the vaccine race is on, but answers about treatments remain frustratingly elusive, with a handful of basic therapies supported by evidence, and a messy and imperfect scramble to extract information about what works from what has been given to thousands of patients. Therapeutic regimens vary from hospital to hospital, and much of what is offered is supported by hints and hunches — what official treatment guidelines refer to as a knowledge gap. There's a lot of things about this pandemic that have been so challenging, and I just don't think in the early days people really appreciated how important it was to set up rigorous clinical studies right away of treatments, said Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. We're so focused on a vaccine , and hopefully they work. We're a little less focused on drug trials and other treatments. Among other therapies, Jeff Seidel was given the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. It has since fallen out of vogue, in large part because of a big clinical trial in the United Kingdom that tested multiple drugs against placebos and found it did not work. The National Institutes of Health is preparing to launch a large, randomized trial to formally test different doses of blood thinners, which have been widely used to treat blood clots caused by the virus. Blood plasma from people who have recovered has now been given to more than 60,000 covid -19 patients, but the evidence that it works is still only suggestive. It is unfortunate we don't have the kinds of data we would like to have now, said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

After his visit with his daughter, Dr. Harris was waiting for his return flight in Portland when the first Oregon coronavirus case was announced; he had dinner at a busy airport bar and thought about how quiet the place would be in a week or two when the reality of the outbreak set in. Once home, he recreated his graphic and posted it on Twitter and LinkedIn, and was pleased to see the enthusiastic interest in flattening the curve. “Now I know what going viral means,” Dr. Harris said. (For a more detailed analysis, see a recent paper in The Lancet, “How will country-based mitigation measures influence the course of the COVID -19 epidemic?”) The following is an edited version of our email conversation. What does it mean to “flatten the curve”? The ideal goal in fighting an epidemic or pandemic is to completely halt the spread. But merely slowing it — mitigation — is critical. This reduces the number of cases that are active at any given time, which in turn gives doctors, hospitals, police, schools and vaccine -manufacturers time to prepare and respond, without becoming overwhelmed. Most hospitals can function with 10 percent reduction in staff, but not with half their people out at once.

{"id": 2721, "text": "Comparing their risks So far, it seems those most at risk for severe complications from covid -19 are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions. The same goes for influenza, though young children appear to be more susceptible to the flu than they are to the coronavirus , data shows. Children younger than age 5, especially those under age 2, are at a high risk of developing serious health complications from the flu, according to the CDC. Which virus is more deadly? That's a difficult question to answer for many reasons. First, health officials are not comparing analogous data sets between the viruses. They have years of influenza data but just months of covid -19 numbers - which are evolving by the day. It's possible the estimated death rates for the coronavirus might be inflated because a considerable number of people likely have or had the virus but were not diagnosed because their symptoms were too mild to see a doctor. There is also a number of asymptomatic infections we don't know about, Nolan said. World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news briefing last week that the global case fatality rate for the coronavirus is believed to be about 3.4 percent, higher than the 2.3 percent reported in a China CDC study released in February. But a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week found a death rate of 1.4 percent among a group of 1,099 patients, suggesting the rate could be lower than those reported by the WHO and Chinese officials. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected, Tedros said of the global flu caseload during the news briefing. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that the mortality rate for seasonal flu is 0.1 percent.

Mir, the infectious disease doctor in Boston, said many families have failed to come in to have their children vaccinated this year out of fear of being exposed to the coronavirus . She has also heard of pushback against a COVID -19 vaccine once it’s available, which is consistent with a Gallup poll released Aug. 7 that showed 35% of Americans would not get the vaccine even if it were free and approved by the Federal Drug Administration. Vaccine hesitancy has become a major issue for public health officials, part of what Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist, has referred to as an “anti-science bias.’’ The problem may have been exacerbated by increasing evidence of political pressure on the CDC and the FDA. 'Failure of public trust' a complicating factor Barbara Koenig, a bioethics expert at University of California, San Francisco who served on the advisory committee to the CDC’s director, notes that there’s a social dimension to the pandemic response that’s reflected in the public’s attitudes toward wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and accepting vaccinations . “In some cases, the idea that freedom is the most important value is very, very powerful,’’ Koenig said. “We also are existing in a moment of failure of public trust or lack of trustworthiness, and a reduced belief in scientific expertise. Those things make our efforts to deal with both flu and COVID difficult.’’ And they only figure to add to the hardship experienced by patients in health centers like the one where Mir practices. One of those patients, the woman from Guatemala, was not seeking treatment for her illness but rather authorization to work through it. Mir told her she needed to isolate herself. “She started crying, saying, ‘I have no money. I live paycheck to paycheck. Give me cough medicine and I promise I’m not going to cough in front of anyone.

{"id": 2731, "text": "Henry said that school resource officers are rarely involved in suspensions “unless an arrest is necessary.” The district also offers professional learning opportunities for staffers, and sometimes community members including parents, on topics such as cultural proficiency, inclusivity and implicit bias. One workshop focuses on how to implement culturally responsive restorative practices instead of traditional disciplinary measures. While the training is not mandatory, last school year about 600 people attended the introductory Isolating Race workshop, a prerequisite for many of the other sessions, according to Angela Ward, the district’s race equity administrative supervisor. 'A scary reality': Students react to colleges' reopening plans with mix of optimism, fear Groups call for school police reform A group of local social justice organizations called on the Austin school district to ensure greater equality on campuses and divest from school policing, citing the “physical and psychological harms of over policing on students from minority communities as well as those with disabilities.” In a letter sent June 9 to departing Superintendent Paul Cruz and copied to the Austin school board, four Texas-based partnering organizations – the Children’s Defense Fund Texas, Disability Rights Texas, the Earl Carl Institute at Texas Southern University and Texas Appleseed – asked the district to take measures to ensure equality, including reallocating money currently going toward policing to hiring and training mental health counselors and social workers to handle instances of bullying, harassment, disruptive behavior, vandalism, drug and alcohol abuse, and other nonviolent incidents. The groups also sent letters to school districts in Dallas, San Antonio and Houston. “In this moment of heightened awareness of the trauma experienced by so many at the hands of police officers, AISD should follow in the footsteps of other districts, like Portland Public Schools and Minneapolis Public Schools, by divesting in school policing,” the letter states. Many school districts have contracts with local police departments to supply school resource officers, while others, such as the Austin district, have their own internal police departments. School resource officer programs originated in the 1950s but grew dramatically nationwide during the 1990s, a trend that coincided with the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. In Texas today, more than 200 school districts have their own police forces. In recent weeks, school districts across the U.S. have reevaluated their relationships with the police. The Minneapolis and Denver school districts terminated their contracts with city police departments, and Charlottesville, Virginia, and Portland, Oregon, discontinued the regular presence of their school resource officers. 'This is hell': Parents and kids hate online learning, but they could face more of it The Austin district, with 130 school campuses and more than 80,000 students, employs 84 full-time officers in its police department, including 43 school resource officers, 20 patrol officers and two mental health officers. “Students of color, particularly Black and Hispanic students, are overrepresented in law enforcement referrals for offenses,” the letter states. “Students can face expulsion or suspension when referred to law enforcement. In fact, when law enforcement charges students, they are almost always also suspended or expelled.” Parents, residents call for shifting of funds At a school board meeting last week, several dozen parents and Austin residents called on the district to reallocate funds from its police department and put the money towards restorative justice practices, counseling and other support services.", "annotations": [], "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null}

Students can switch from in-person to online learning at any time this school year, but the mayor has said they can no longer sign up for classroom instruction. The latest numbers came as many parents, educators and elected officials were mired in an intense debate about whether the city’s schools should had been closed at all. Yet the figures demonstrate that the conflict over in-person instruction is relevant for a minority of city families. That highlights a harsh reality for Mr. de Blasio’s administration, which has put schools at the center of the push to revive New York City and its economy after it became a global epicenter of the virus in the spring. And the fact that just under half of Black and Latino families have chosen to keep their children learning at home undermines the mayor’s argument that public school parents, who are overwhelmingly low-income parents of color, demanded open classrooms. The mayor had expected most children to return to school buildings because of the widely acknowledged inferiority of remote learning compared with in-person classes, and the enormous child care challenge that remote learning has created for working families. “I think if you went from March 2020 theoretically all the way to September 2021 and a kid never got into a classroom with an educator and caring adults that can help them, it would’ve been a massive mistake,” Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on Friday morning, before the new numbers were released. Now the mayor is presiding over a school system in which white children, who make up just 15 percent of the public school population, have had a disproportionate presence in classrooms during the pandemic. The most recent survey of parents indicated that white families were choosing remote learning at the lowest rates of any racial group. New York stands apart from the rest of the country for the enormous size of its public school system: The number of children set to return to classrooms is roughly equivalent to the total enrollment of Miami’s public school district, the nation’s fourth-largest. Still, the numbers fell far short of the mayor’s predictions. In July, Mr. de Blasio said he expected only about a quarter of parents to keep their children learning at home when schools reopened. It was clear by October that the city would fall significantly short of that goal, but the mayor still called the preliminary enrollment number “a work in progress” when he announced it.

A department spokesman said the January dates that Jones referenced are not necessarily when a person tested positive for the virus. Those dates could also represent the first day someone came into contact with an infected person or went to a place where he or she may have contracted the virus, the statement said. Epidemiologists collect information that informs the Department of Health of an individual's symptoms, contacts and location of where they may have acquired COVID -19, said the spokesman, Alberto Moscoso. The first date of entry in answer to any question, COVID -related or not, is designated the event date. Many event dates are months before a person became sick, he added. In an additional statement Monday, Moscoso said Jones's dashboard aggregates disparate sets of data without considering many of the important guidelines utilized by epidemiologists. He said that epidemiologists do not recommend combining active virus tests with antibody tests and that by counting nonresidents' deaths, Jones enables each of those fatalities to be tallied in two states. Moscoso also said Jones's count of recovered cases cannot completely capture the number of people who have regained their health. Despite the differences between the state's dashboard and Jones's dashboard, Jones's site relies on the health department's data. She said she wrote code that pulls information from various reports on the department's website and presents the data in a way that she thinks adds more context. Her dashboard also incorporates data from hospitals and from a volunteer organization that maps coronavirus testing sites. On Jones's dashboard, the number of people tested is significantly lower than the official figure. She said the state's number is actually a tally of the number of samples taken — not the number of people tested.

In a blog post, the company argued that the administration neither provided “evidence that TikTok was an actual threat, nor justification for its punitive actions.” President Trump has said the Chinese-owned company posed a threat because of ties to Beijing.

Jordan sent Gilead's screening library to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and to Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., home to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ). Scientists at both federal facilities study dangerous viruses in high-security biocontainment labs. The National Institutes of Health and academic labs in Tennessee and North Carolina that receive NIH grants also would play key roles studying the drug in mice. Front-line government scientists who worked directly with Gilead on the drug described the heavy involvement of federal resources in the drug's development, although they said their concern at the time was not patents but speeding treatments in the battle against dangerous diseases, especially Ebola. The former chief scientific officer at USAMRIID who supervised the development of remdesivir, Sina Bavari, said the team was working rapidly on a treatment for Ebola in 2014 and did not consider filing a patent application when the agency's scientists helped discover new uses of the drug and tested it in government monkeys. Bavari and other government scientists were co-authors of an article in the scientific journal Nature that described its discovery and successful tests in the government's rhesus monkeys. Gilead contributed the drug and spent millions from its own budgets to hone the drug's formulation, Bavari said. Bavari, who now runs his own consulting company, said deciding when to file a government patent in the case of industry partnerships presents a tightrope for public health agencies that want to maintain positive relationships with industry partners. Many antiviral drugs are taken for a short time and given to relatively few people. They don't represent large markets, so government subsidies are required to keep corporations interested in pursuing treatments, he said. Without incentivizing some of these companies to stay attached to emerging disease, I think they will walk away, even after this one, he said. In this situation [filing for a government patent] would have caused more harm with Gilead and not been worth it. The government's job is to make sure industry is successful, and if industry is successful, then we all benefit from it.

The Justice Department nevertheless seems primed to produce some scalps for the public. (Federal prosecutors charged two Rhode Island businessmen last week with fraud for overreporting their employee count to increase their loan, though that case was initiated by an informant tip rather than Justice's general review of the PPP.) As the investigation proceeds, there is a significant risk that it will ensnare desperate proprietors of small businesses who were rushing to tap a finite and insufficient liquidity source—one that was open for a short period with no guarantee that more money would be available in the future—and who struggled through a hurried approval process. The application was hardly straightforward: It was based mostly on a the applicant's average monthly payroll in 2019, but Treasury guidance compelled most companies to complete most of their 2019 taxes before applying, even though those taxes aren't due until July. Applicants also had to exclude compensation to employees exceeding $100,000 (but not fringe benefits to those same employees), as well as compensation to any employees whose principal place of residence was outside the U.S. Things were even more complicated for seasonal businesses for which year-to-year business cycles don't track with the calendar year. Technical challenges like these—plus the struggle to navigate reams of Treasury guidance that seemed to change by the day—will make it difficult to distinguish intentional misconduct from honest mistakes. Nearly 75% of the loans in the first PPP tranche were for less than $150,000, as were 90% in the second tranche, indicating that most applicants were small businesses without extensive compliance teams and resources.
